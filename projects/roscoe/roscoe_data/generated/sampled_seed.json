The cold open, which featured the assassination of the president of the fictional \"banana republic\" of San Marcos and a coup d'Ã©tat that brings Gen. Emilio Molina Vargas (Carlos Montalban) to power, sets up the situation in which Mellish would become embroiled. The scene was in the form of a championship boxing telecast on Wide World of Sports, with Don Dunphy as the host and Howard Cosell as the commentator.[4] Mellish is a neurotic blue collar man who tries to impress social activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) by trying to get in touch with the revolution in San Marcos. He visits the republic and attempts to show his concern for the native people. However, he is nearly killed by the local caudillo and then saved by the revolutionaries, putting him in their debt. Mellish then learns, clumsily, how to be a revolutionary. When the revolution is successful, the Castro-style leader goes mad, forcing the rebels to place Mellish as their President. When traveling back to the U.S. to obtain financial aid, he reunites with his activist ex-girlfriend and is exposed. In a classic courtroom scene, Mellish tries to defend himself from a series of incriminating witnesses, including a reigning Miss America and a middle-aged African-American woman claiming to be J. Edgar Hoover in disguise. One of the witnesses does provide testimony favorable to Mellish, but the court clerk, when asked to read back this testimony, replies with an entirely different, wholly unfavorable rendition. \nMellish is eventually sentenced to prison, but his sentence is suspended on the condition that he does not move into the judge's neighborhood. Nancy then agrees to marry him. The film ends with the between-the-covers consummation of their marriage, an event that was over much more quickly than Nancy had anticipated. Like the opening scene, it was accompanied by Cosell providing commentary.\nMy question: What is Feilding Mellish's occupation?",

After serving in the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, he was appointed by King George I as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1716.  His tenure was marked by virulent disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly on a variety of issues, and by poorly conducted diplomacy with respect to the Native American Wabanaki Confederacy of northern New England that led to Dummer's War . Although Shute was partly responsible for the breakdown in negotiations with the Wabanakis, he returned to England in early 1723 to procure resolutions to his ongoing disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly, leaving conduct of the war to Lieutenant Governor William Dummer.  His protests resulted in the issuance in 1725 of the Explanatory Charter, essentially confirming his position in the disputes with the assembly.  He did not return to New England, being replaced as governor in 1728 by William Burnet, and refused to be considered for reappointment after Burnet's sudden death in 1729. Thomas Hutchinson , in his history of Massachusetts, described Shute's tenure as governor as the most contentious since the Antinomian Controversy of the 1630s.\n\nQuestion: Who was governor first: William Dummer or William Burnet?\n\nAnswer:",

Maha Thiha Thura had now assumed the overall command, replacing Maha Sithu. The smaller army, led by Maha Sithu, continued to pursue Ming Rui while the larger army led by Maha Thiha Thura advanced through the mountainous route to emerge directly behind the Chinese. Through careful maneuvering, the Burmese managed to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese at modern-day Pyinoolwin , about 50 miles northeast of Ava. Over the course of three days of bloody fighting, the Bannerman army was completely annihilated. The slaughter was such that the Burmese could hardly grip their swords as the hilts were slippery with enemy blood. Of the original 30,000 men of the main army, only 2500 remained alive and were captured. The rest had been killed either on the battlefield, through disease or through execution after their surrender. Ming Rui himself was severely wounded in battle. Only a small group managed to break through and escaped the carnage. Ming Rui himself could have escaped with that group. Instead, he cut off his queue and sent it to the emperor as a token of his loyalty by those who were escaping. He then hanged himself on a tree.

During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church  declared Olaf a saint in 1164. His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada, was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, only to die in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The authenticity of the battle as a historical event is subject to question. Contemporary sources say the king was murdered. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 1030, Olaf was killed by his own people. Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances.

The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \"RIGHT\" or \"WRONG\".\n\nTLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis did happen a few years ago but to this day it still haunts me. I met a girl at work (lets call her T), and she was perfect. We went out a few times and everything was good. Unfortunately T had to move away for school, not super far but far enough that we couldn't hang out to much. \n\nNow T and her sister (we can call the sister K) both worked with me. I was not the biggest fan of K but she was the sister of T, and i was determined to be in good graces with her, as Those two were very close.  So, maybe a week after T went back to school, I was working a shift with K and another friend (we can call him Q) the first half of the shift was fine, people pouring in and we barely had time to talk. Things took a turn when we all went on break together. I was craving a burrito and there was a Starbucks near by where I was going, so I offered K a ride since she was going there. We get back and Q is sitting there in the break room. \n\nWe sit down and Q looks at me and asks if I want to see this YouTube video of \"The Ultimate Vape\". I'm bored and have nothing better to do so I agree. We get to the point where its time to choose the flavor for the vape, and its churro flavor. This is what sets off the argument, because the man in the video didn't roll the R in churro (this is important to K because her and T are both half Black half Mexican women).  this is the conversation that followed.\n\nQ: Some people just can't roll their R's.\n\nK: That's why i hate White people,\n\nQ: ... that's kind of racist...\n\nThat's all i can fully remember was said but the events that followed were K saying you can't be racist towards White people and that's what THEIR argument was about. I considered both K and Q to be my friends but they were not necessarily friends with each other. So I sit aside let them have at it because if I choose a side I'm definitely loosing one of them as a friend.\n\nAt some point K turns to me, and she says,\n\nK: hey LexeL... I forgot my phone in my car, can you use yours to look up the definition of Racism?\n\nMe: I'm sorry K but this is between you two and id rather not get in the middle.\n\nAnd then she goes back to Q. i should mention that arguing over the Dictionary definition of racism had gone on for 3 minutes prior to this conversation. and Q had correctly said, Word for Word, what the definition of Racism was but K would not accept it.\n\nWe can skip to the end of break. I'm getting ready to go downstairs and K stops me.\n\nK: Have you talked to T lately?\n\nMe: Well I messaged her on Friday, but I know shes busy so I don't expect to talk to her until we Skype tomorrow. Why?\n\nK: Oh... well i just would expect to hear from her at all.\n\nThis interaction led me to believe that K had talked to T way before her argument with Q, and that she knew something I didn't, I spent the rest of my shift, nerves on end hoping I'd get to the bottom of this. \n\nK got off work before I did, terrible start to the rest of my night TBH. So as soon as I get off work this is the following conversation that I know by heart.\n\nText messages -\n\nT: what are you playing at??\n\nMe: Listen, idk what you've heard, who you've talked to, or what you're thinking, but I think we should talk.\n\nT: I agree.\n\nMe: Are you able to Skype tonight?\n\nT: We should just call on the phone...\n\nMe: okay.\n\nI have quite the drive home and I call her as soon as its over, we have a long talk about the situation that happened and she says that my story lines up with K's story. But... sadly I was in the wrong. Because I took no side in the situation, I actually took Q's side. \"a bystander is just taking the oppressors side without vocalizing it\" T said that she didn't think we should continue talking. We said goodbye for the last time and I never really got over it. so Am i the Asshole for not choosing her sisters side when her sister was wrong?\n\nTLDR; The sister of the girl I was seeing and another friend got into an argument about the definition of racism during break and i didn't choose a side, thus making me the bad guy in the eyes of the girl i was seeing.\n\nI wanna thank anyone for reading, even the TLDR, and I appreciate any comments. I'm just looking to learn from a past experience.\n\nThanks again!",

We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably.

The upper wing was swept back 10\u00b0. This is a common trick when a change in an aircraft's design moves the center of gravity to the rear; rather than moving the whole wing back to counter for the shift, it is easier to simply angle the wings back slightly, which requires very little change to the basic design, or even the overall structure of the wing. (The similarly angled wings on the Fairey Swordfish are due to just such a mid-program change to the weight distribution of the aircraft.) The tailplane was mounted high and braced by struts. The undercarriage was fixed, and the tail was fitted with a skid rather than a wheel. The He 46 prototype first flew in late 1931; its flight characteristics were good, but design improvements were incorporated. The small lower wing was removed, while the mainplane was increased in area by 22% and braced to the fuselage, transforming the He 46 into a parasol-wing monoplane. A more powerful engine was added to the second prototype, and a single 7.92\u00a0mm (.312\u00a0in) MG 15 machine gun for the rear seat was added to the third prototype.\n",

Always cook or freeze the chicken within two days of bringing it home, regardless of what the package date tells you. Never store raw chicken in the refrigerator at home for longer than two days. Once you've cleared up what belongs where, the next step is knowing how long the food will last. Storing food is a delicate matter -- in the fridge, food might get moist and moldy, and in the freezer it could lose all its moisture or get freezer burn. If you leave food in the fridge or freezer too long, it could not only lose its integrity but it may also become unsafe to eat. FoodSafety.gov has two useful charts listing how long certain foods will stay good in both the refrigerator and the freezer. The first chart lists all kinds of commonly refrigerated foods and the second is specifically for eggs and food made with eggs.

Thanks for your help, SS. Dear SS: According to Foodsafety.gov, whole, uncooked poultry (chicken or turkey) is safe in the refrigerator for 1-2 days and safe in the freezer for up to 12 months. Poultry pieces are safe in the refrigerator for 1-2 days and safe in the freezer for up to nine months. Cooked poultry is safe refrigerated for 3-4 days and in the freezer for 2-6 months. You can also freeze your cooked breaded chicken cutlets (Foodsafety.gov specifically lists nuggets and patties) for 1-3 months. How long can you keep chicken in the fridge? Raw chicken: You'll need to either cook or freeze it fast. According to recommendations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, raw chicken will only keep in the refrigerator for about 1-2 days. (Same goes for turkey and other poultry.) If you store it in the freezer in a sealed, freezer-safe container or vacuum-sealed package, it should stay safe to thaw and eat for up to 9 months, in pieces, or up to 12 months, for a whole chicken. Cooked chicken: You have a little more time, but not much. I have to say that I have kept chicken in the fridge for longer than 2 days and not died. Some even have best before dates 3-4 days in. The quality definitely suffers, and I'm sure there's some risk, but it's probably low. How long does raw chicken last after being frozen and thawed? Chicken that has been defrosted in the fridge can be kept for an additional 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator before cooking; chicken that was thawed in the microwave or in cold water should be cooked immediately. I didn't even realize it until the next day when I found the container with the fresh chicken and realized that there were two containers of it in the fridge because I'd forgotten to throw away the old chicken from the previous week.

This study investigates A20 expression in human glioma tissues and four glioma cell lines, and its effect on tumorigenesis of glioma cells and a mouse tumor model.   \n METHODS Human glioma tissue samples and cells were subject to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Glioma cells was tested by flow cytometry. A xenograft tumor model in mice was utilized to examine the knock-down effect of specific A20 siRNAs on tumorigenesis.   \n RESULTS A20 was overexpressed in clinical glioma tissue samples (63.9%) and correlated with clinical staging. All four human glioma cell lines expressed A20, among which U87 displayed the strongest expression signals. Inhibiting A20 expression by siRNAs in vitro reduced the growth rates of glioma cells and resulted in G1/S arrest and increased apoptosis. In a mouse tumor model, local administration of siRNA significantly suppressed solid tumor growth.   \n CONCLUSIONS A20 was overexpressed both in human glioma tissues and cell lines, and inhibiting A20 expression greatly slowed tumor cell growth in culture and in mice.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.\n\nThe description of neural computations in the field of neuroscience relies on two competing views: (i) a classical single-cell view that relates the activity of individual neurons to sensory or behavioural variables, and focuses on how different cell classes map onto computations; (ii) a more recent population view that instead characterises computations in terms of collective neural trajectories, and focuses on the dimensionality of these trajectories as animals perform tasks. How the two key concepts of cell classes and low-dimensional trajectories interact to shape neural computations is however currently not understood. Here we address this question by combining machine-learning tools for training RNNs with reverse-engineering and theoretical analyses of network dynamics. We introduce a novel class of theoretically tractable recurrent networks: low-rank, mixture of Gaussian RNNs. In these networks, the rank of the connectivity controls the dimensionality of the dynamics, while the number of components in the Gaussian mixture corresponds to the number of cell classes. Using back-propagation, we determine the minimum rank and number of cell classes needed to implement neuroscience tasks of increasing complexity. We then exploit mean-field theory to reverse-engineer the obtained solutions and identify the respective roles of dimensionality and cell classes. We show that the rank determines the phase-space available for dynamics that implement input-output mappings, while having multiple cell classes allows networks to flexibly switch between different types of dynamics in the available phase-space. Our results have implications for the analysis of neuroscience experiments and the development of explainable AI.",
