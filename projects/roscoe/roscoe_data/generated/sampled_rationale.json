In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other.;\nAnswer: two;\nQuestion:",

She slowly gets out of the shower and puts the red dress laid on the bed on. She exits the bedroom into a hallway and looks around with the distinct feeling of being hunted. She finds her way into the laser room from the first movie, and just before getting cubed she leaps into a vent, crawls through, and drops into.... a hospital corridor. The halls are eerily empty, and Alice stumbles. She grabs a nearby rolling bed to steady herself on, but the bed is promptly cut in two by a giant guillotine (think the blades from that one scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). She smiles grimly and picks her way past the blade only to get gunned down by a second trap that springs out of the floor and fires bullets in every direction. As her body lies there, three Umbrella scientists approach. One of them is Dr. Issacs (Iain Glen). He tells the others to take a blood sample of that and get rid of it, which they do by throwing it in an outdoor pit filled with dead Alices. As the scientists do so, we see that this whole facility is but one small part of a giant underground base of the Umbrella Corporation, somewhere in the North American west.Now Alice -- the real one -- gives us an update from the previous movie 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. She tells us that although Umbrella thought Raccoon City was an isolated incident, it soon spread. Within weeks, the T-Virus had spread to the entire North American continent, and within months, the world. It affected everything, killing nearly all plant life and turning the world into a desert.

Since metal-based meteors are not subject to these metal fatigue stresses, the scientists want to recover samples before they enter the Earth's atmosphere to discover how the meteors' \"outer shell\" protects them. To accomplish this, they need to send men into space, something that has never been done before.

Lockwood suffers a mental breakdown when his view screen shows Gordon's still space-suited but now skeletal and weightless body floating toward him. Panicked and delusional, he fires his rocket engines and blasts away from Earth, heading into deep space to his doom. Stanton then misses the main swarm, but a stray meteor crosses his orbital path.

The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. A 1973 military coup saw a change of leadership, but pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their plane was shot down in April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\nRwanda's economy suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened.

She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \"The Locomotion\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \"I Should Be So Lucky\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \"Special Achievement Award\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \"The Locomotion\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \"Got to Be Certain\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \"Especially for You\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \"the Singing Budgie\" by her detractors over the coming years.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \"Can't answer\".\nQuestion: Who plays princess Gilda?\nTitle: I'll Never Heil Again\nMovie plot: At the estate of King Herman the 6\u00e2\u0085\u009e (Don Brodie) (a parody of Kaiser Wilhelm II), the deposed king of Moronica, war profiteers Ixnay (Vernon Dent), Amscray (Lynton Brent) and Umpchay (previously Onay) (Bud Jamison) have decided that they have had enough of Moe Hailstone, the fascist dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. To this end, his daughter, the princess Gilda (Mary Ainslee), threatens to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive Number 13 pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. The fictitious country of Moronica seems to be familiar with a pool game in which the 13 ball is placed at the head of the rack during set up.[1]\nDictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Field Marshal Herring (Curly) and Minister of Propaganda (Larry) for a turkey (a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \"I'll wipe out grease\"). The winner of that battle is a portrait of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges, before running out of his frame. At a loss, Hailstone starts crying.\nGilda enters, and shows the Stooges a glimpse through a telescope of all three of them on a spit roasting in Hell and starts to place in Hailstone's mind the idea that his allies, the \"Axel\" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this, she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with the explosive 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the rest of the game, the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics, thereby avoiding the explosive ball by swerving around it and finally jumping over it, colliding with Herring's head.\nLater, the Axel partners arrive for a meeting. The partners consist of Chiselini (Cy Schindell; a parody of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini), the Bey of Rum (Jack \"Tiny\" Lipson); an unnamed Japanese delegate (Nick Arno; a parody of Japanese emperor Hirohito (\u00e8\u00a3\u0095\u00e4\u00bb\u0081?)); and an unnamed Russian delegate...\n",

He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (b\u00f3sh\u00ec \u535a\u58eb) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551\u2013479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179\u2013104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe. The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD.

It was conducted by the United States Army at 5:29 a.m. on July 16, 1945, as part of the Manhattan Project. The test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about 35 miles (56 km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what was then the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, now part of White Sands Missile Range. The only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components. A base camp was constructed, and there were 425 people present on the weekend of the test.\nThe code name \"Trinity\" was assigned by Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, inspired by the poetry of John Donne. The test was of an implosion-design plutonium device, informally nicknamed \"The Gadget\", of the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. The complexity of the design required a major effort from the Los Alamos Laboratory, and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test. The test was planned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge.\nFears of a fizzle led to the construction of a steel containment vessel called Jumbo that could contain the plutonium, allowing it to be recovered, but Jumbo was not used. A rehearsal was held on May 7, 1945, in which 108 short tons (96 long tons; 98 t) of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes were detonated. The Gadget's detonation released the explosive energy of about 22 kilotons of TNT (92 TJ). Observers included Vannevar Bush, James Chadwick, James Conant, Thomas Farrell, Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Leslie Groves, Robert Oppenheimer, Geoffrey Taylor, and Richard Tolman.\nThe test site was declared a National Historic Landmark district in 1965, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year., can you guess it ?\n\n",

On August 13, 1865, the French forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of Chihuahua City, and on August 15, 1865, General Brincourt defeated the republican forces, taking control of the state capital. Brincourt designated Tom\u00e1s Zuloaga as Prefect of Chihuahua. Fearing the French would continue their campaign to El Paso del Norte, President Ju\u00e1rez relocated to El Carrizal, a secluded place in the mountains near El Paso del Norte, in August 1865, . It would have been easy for the French forces to continue in pursuit of President Ju\u00e1rez across the border, but they feared altercations with American forces. General Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine ordered the French troops to retreat back to the state of Durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of Chihuahua City.

Several institutions, besides those already mentioned, played important parts. Such is the Biblical school at Jerusalem, open to the religious of the order and to secular clerics, which publishes the Revue Biblique. The faculty of theology at the University of Fribourg, confided to the care of the Dominicans in 1890, is flourishing, and has about 250 students. The Pontificium Collegium Internationale Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum established at Rome in 1908 by Master Hyacinth Cormier, opened its doors to regulars and seculars for the study of the sacred sciences. In addition to the reviews above are the Revue Thomiste, founded by P\u00e8re Thomas Coconnier (d. 1908), and the Analecta Ordinis Pr\u00e6dicatorum (1893). Among numerous writers of the order in this period are: Cardinals Thomas Zigliara (d. 1893) and Zephirin Gonz\u00e1lez (d. 1894), two esteemed philosophers; Alberto Guillelmotti (d. 1893), historian of the Pontifical Navy, and Heinrich Denifle, one of the most famous writers on medieval history (d. 1905).[citation needed]",

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.\n\nDavid is a doctor who works for the public health department.

They have been pondering about how to communicate with each other in a doomsday scenario when all the electronic devices would be useless. They connected their houses with three ducts. \nOne of the ducts is filled with air; they called it channel A. Another duct is filled with water; they \ncalled it channel B. And the last duct is filled with iron; they called it channel C. They can now transmit sound with these channels of communication; in case, disaster strikes.\n\nHint: In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.\n",

While Paige works the cash register at a local store, she and Mari meet Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), a teenager passing through town who invites them both back to his roadside motel room to smoke some marijuana.

Like Out of Time, Monster topped the charts in both the US and UK. The record sold about nine million copies worldwide. The singles \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" and \"Bang and Blame\" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from Monster reached the Top 30 on the British charts. Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from Automatic for the People for release as Parallel in 1995.In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road.

The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros.

Symphony Hall (located west of Back Bay) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, (and the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra, which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation) and the Boston Pops Orchestra. The British newspaper The Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall \"one of the top venues for classical music in the world,\" adding that \"Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design.\" Other concerts are held at the New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall. The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston Opera House. Other performing-arts organizations located in the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company, Opera Boston, Boston Baroque (the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US), and the Handel and Haydn Society (one of the oldest choral companies in the United States). The city is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups, several of which are associated with the city's conservatories and universities.

Anglican churches that were built were designed internally to allow maximum audibility, and visibility, for preaching, so the main nave was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans, and often there were no side-aisles. Galleries were common in new churches. Especially in country parishes, the external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a Gothic church, with a tower or spire, a large west front with one or more doors, and very large windows along the nave, but all with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary.

This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson.\n\nNow, I have a new situation: Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature.

        "source": "Information:\n\n- Mariner 9 (Mariner Mars '71 / Mariner-I) was an unmanned NASA space probe that contributed greatly to the exploration of Mars and was part of the Mariner program. Mariner 9 was launched toward Mars on May 30, 1971 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and reached the planet on November 14 of the same year, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet  only narrowly beating the Soviets' Mars 2 and Mars 3, which both arrived within a month. After months of dust storms it managed to send back clear pictures of the surface.\n\n- Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli (14 March 1835  4 July 1910) was an Italian astronomer and science historian.\n\n- Margaritifer Terra is an ancient, heavily cratered region of Mars. It is centered just south of the Martian equator at and covers 2600\u00a0km at its widest extent. The area reveals \"chaos terrain\", outflow channels, and alluvial plains that are indicative of massive flooding. Wind erosion patterns are also in evidence. A region within the terra shows some of the highest valley network densities on the planet. Ares Vallis is another notable feature, where the flood and flow patterns are in evidence; it was the landing site of \"Mars 6\" and NASA's \"Mars Pathfinder\". It is also one of several proposed landing sites for the Mars 2020 Rover.\n\n- A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \"terrestrial planet\" and \"telluric planet\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\"Terra\" and \"Tellus\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \"Earth-like\".\n\n- The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.\nAbout three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.\n\n- A rift valley is a linear-shaped lowland between several highlands or mountain ranges created by the action of a geologic rift or fault. A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary, a crustal extension, a spreading apart of the surface, which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion. When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart, a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks, forming a graben. The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new. That feature is the beginning of the rift valley, but as the process continues, the valley widens, until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area. One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift. On Earth, rifts can occur at all elevations, from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust. They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys, which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically.\n\n- Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \"Red Planet\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.\n\n- An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.\n\n- Xanthe Terra is a large area on Mars, centered just north of the Martian equator. Its coordinates are and it covers 2465 km at its broadest extent. Its name means \"golden-yellow land.\" It is in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle, and the Oxia Palus quadrangle.\nImages from Mars Express, Mars Global Surveyor, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed ancient river valleys and deltas. The deltas show many thin layers just as deltas on Earth. Scientists speculate that features in Xanthe Terra show evidence of precipitation on early Mars.\n\n- Iani Chaos is a region of chaos terrain at the south end of the outflow channel Ares Vallis, of the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) region of the planet Mars, centered at approximately ~342\u00b0E, 2\u00b0S. This is the source region of Ares Vallis. The chaotic terrain is widely believed to have formed via the removal of subsurface water or ice, resulting in flooding at the surface, and the formation of Ares Vallis. Within Iani Chaos, deposited stratigraphically above the chaotic terrain, are smooth, low-slope, intermediate-to-light-toned deposits that are rich in a hydrated mineral that is most likely gypsum as well as hematite.\n\n- Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.\n\n- Mars Pathfinder (MESUR Pathfinder) is an American robotic spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997. It consisted of a lander, renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, and a lightweight (10.6\u00a0kg/23\u00a0lb) wheeled robotic Mars rover named \"Sojourner\", which became the first rover to operate outside \nthe Earth-Moon system.\n\n- The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. \n\n- An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.\n\n- Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide typically containing traces of iron, titanium, vanadium and chromium. It is a rock-forming mineral. It is a naturally transparent material, but can have different colors when impurities are present. Transparent specimens are used as gems, called \"ruby\" if red and \"padparadscha\" if pink-orange. All other colors are called \"sapphire\", e.g., \"green sapphire\" for a green specimen.\n\n- Valles Marineris (Latin for \"Mariner Valleys\", named after the \"Mariner 9\" Mars orbiter of 197172 which discovered it) is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than long, wide and up to deep, Valles Marineris is one of the largest canyons of the Solar System, surpassed in length only by the rift valleys of Earth.\n\n- Ares Vallis is an outflow channel on Mars, named after the Greek name for Mars: Ares, the god of war; it appears to have been carved by fluids, perhaps water. The valley 'flows' northwest out of the hilly Margaritifer Terra, where the Iani Chaos depression long and wide) is connected to the beginning of Ares Vallis by a wide transition zone centered on 342.5\u00b0 East (17.5 West) and 3\u00b0 North. It then continues through the ancient Xanthe Terra highlands, and ends in a delta-like region of Chryse Planitia. Ares Vallis was the landing site of NASA's \"Mars Pathfinder\" spacecraft, which studied a region of the valley near the border with Chryse in 1997.\n\n- Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater approximately east of Flagstaff and west of Winslow in the northern Arizona desert of the United States. Because the United States Board on Geographic Names commonly recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of \"Meteor Crater\" from the nearby post office named Meteor. The site was formerly known as the Canyon Diablo Crater and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite. Scientists refer to the crater as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer, who was first to suggest that it was produced by meteorite impact. The crater is privately owned by the Barringer family through their Barringer Crater Company, which proclaims it to be the \"best preserved meteorite crater on Earth\".\n\n- Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.\n\n- Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above .\n\n- Aram Chaos , centered at 2.6 \u00b0 N , 21.5 \u00b0 W , comprises a heavily eroded impact crater on the planet Mars . It lies at the eastern end of the large canyon Valles Marineris and close to Ares Vallis . Various geological processes have reduced it to a circular area of chaotic terrain . Aram Chaos takes its name from Aram , one of the classical albedo features observed by Giovanni Schiaparelli , who named it after the Biblical land of Aram . Spectroscopic observation from orbit indicates the presence of the mineral hematite , likely a signature of a once aqueous environment . Aram Chaos measures about 280 kilometers ( 170 mi ) across , and lies in a region called Margaritifer Terra , where many water - carved channels show that floods poured out of the highlands onto the northern lowlands ages ago . The Thermal Emission Imaging System ( THEMIS ) on the orbiter Mars Odyssey found gray crystalline hematite on the floor of Aram . CRISM , the spectroscope on the MRO , found hyrdrated sulfates , jarosite , and hematite . Hematite is an iron - oxide mineral that can precipitate when ground water circulates through iron - rich rocks , whether at normal temperatures or in hot springs . The floor of Aram contains huge blocks of collapsed , or chaotic , terrain that formed when water or ice was catastrophically removed . Elsewhere on Mars , the release of groundwater produced massive floods that eroded the large channels seen in Ares Vallis and similar outflow valleys . In Aram Chaos , however , the released water stayed mostly within the crater 's ramparts , eroding only a small , shallow outlet channel in the eastern wall . Several minerals including hematite sulfate minerals , and water - altered silicates in Aram suggests that a lake probably once existed within the crater . Because forming hematite requires liquid water , which could not long exist without a thick atmosphere , Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere at some time in the past .\n\n- Chryse Planitia (Greek, \"\"Golden Plain\"\") is a smooth circular plain in the northern equatorial region of Mars close to the Tharsis region to the west, centered at . Chryse Planitia lies partially in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, partially in the Oxia Palus quadrangle, partially in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle. It is 1600\u00a0km or 994\u00a0mi in diameter and with a floor 2.5\u00a0km below the average planetary surface altitude, and is thought to be an ancient impact basin; it has several features in common with lunar maria, such as wrinkle ridges. The density of impact craters in the range is close to half the average for lunar maria.\n\n\n\nWhat entity does 'aram chaos' has the relation 'location' with?\n\n",

Many of the Eagles' players had indicated they would not attend in response to Trump's harsh criticism of athletes who have refused to stand during pregame performances of the national anthem \u2014 even though all the Eagles stood for the anthem last season.\nTrump relabeled Tuesday's gathering as a \"celebration of the American flag.\" Speaking for 3\u00bd minutes, he told flag-waving invited fans of the team that he wanted to explain why \"young Americans stand for a national anthem. Maybe it's about time we understood.\"\nOne attendee shouted at the president to \"stop hiding behind the armed services and the national anthem.\" That prompted booing and the man was escorted from the event.\nTrump concluded by saying that the celebration turned out to be \"even bigger than we anticipated\" had the football players attended.\nMedia reports said as few as five to 10 players had planned to attend Tuesday's event. \"The vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans,\" the White House said in a statement Tuesday.\n\"The Eagles are the ones who tried to change their commitment at the 11th hour,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters just prior to the event. \"If this wasn't a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned to attend the event and then backed out at the last minute.\"\nA White House statement said Trump withdrew the invitation \"after...\nQuestion: Why were the Eagles mad at Trump?\nOptions:\n\nA.

While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let\u2019s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning.\nThe principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick.\nUnquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place.\nWhere the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants.

According to the 2010 Census, the county had a population of 949,113, estimated to have increased by 2.9% to 976,396 by 2015. Situated in the Hudson Valley, Westchester covers an area of , consisting of 6 cities, 19 towns, and 23 villages. Established in 1683, Westchester was named after the city of Chester, England. The county seat is the city of White Plains.\n\n- The Bronx is the northernmost of the five boroughs of New York City, within the U.S. state of New York. It is geographically south of Westchester County; north and east of the island and borough of Manhattan to the south and west across the Harlem River; and north of the borough of Queens, across the East River. Of the five boroughs, the Bronx is the only one that has the majority of its area on the U.S. mainland and, with a land area of and a population of 1,455,444 in 2015, has the fourth-largest land area, the fourth-highest population, and the third-highest population density. Since 1914, the Bronx has had the same boundaries as Bronx County, a county of New York and the third most densely populated county in the United States.\n\n- A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.\n\n- A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).\n\n- The Bronx River, approximately long, flows through southeast New York in the United States and drains an area of . It is named after colonial settler Jonas Bronck. The Bronx River is the only fresh water river in New York City.\n\n- The Sprain Brook Parkway (also known as The Sprain) is a long northsouth parkway in Westchester County, New York, United States. It begins at an interchange with the Bronx River Parkway in the city of Yonkers, and ends at the former site of the Hawthorne Circle, where it merges into the Taconic State Parkway. The parkway serves an alternate to the Bronx River Parkway, boasting an interchange connection through western Westchester with Interstate\u00a0287. New York's Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) refers to it internally as New York State Route\u00a0987F (NY\u00a0987F), an unsigned reference route. \n\n- New York State Route 100C ( NY 100C ) is an east -- west spur route of NY 100 located in Westchester County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 1.24 miles ( 2.00 km ) as Grasslands Road along the Greenburgh -- Mount Pleasant town line from an intersection with NY 9A ( Saw Mill River Road ) to a junction with NY 100 and NY 100A . NY 100C has a junction with the Sprain Brook Parkway near its eastern terminus . The eastern terminus of NY 100C also serves as NY 100A 's northern endpoint .\n\n- The Bronx River Parkway (sometimes abbreviated as the Bronx Parkway) is a long parkway in downstate New York in the United States. It is named for the nearby Bronx River, which it parallels. The southern terminus of the parkway is at Story Avenue near Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx neighborhood of Soundview. The northern terminus is at the Kensico Circle in North Castle, Westchester County, where the parkway connects to the Taconic State Parkway and, via a short connector, New York State Route\u00a022 (NY\u00a022). Within the Bronx, the parkway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation and is designated New York State Route\u00a0907H (NY\u00a0907H), an unsigned reference route.

It follows a generally northward route midway between the Hudson River and the Connecticut and Massachusetts state lines, along the Taconic Mountains. Its southernmost three miles are a surface road; from the junction with the Sprain Brook Parkway northward it is a limited-access highway. It has grade-separated interchanges from that point to its northern terminus; in the three northern counties there are also at-grade intersections, many with closed medians, allowing only right-in/right-out turns. It is open only to passenger vehicles, as with other parkways in New York, and maintained by the state Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), the fourth agency to have that responsibility.\n\n\n\n'new york state route 100c' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'owned by'?\n\nChoices:\n- castle\n - city\n - connecticut\n - new york city\n - new york state department of transportation\n - united kingdom\n - united states of america\n\n",

        "source": "Information:\n\n- Cr\u00e8me anglaise (French for \"English cream\") is a light pouring custard used as a dessert cream or sauce. It is a mix of sugar, egg yolks and hot milk, often flavoured with vanilla. Its name may derive from the prevalence of sweet custards in English desserts.\n\n- Pudding is a kind of food that can be either a dessert or a savory dish. The word \"pudding\" is believed to come from the French \"boudin\", originally from the Latin \"botellus,\" meaning \"small sausage\", referring to encased meats used in medieval European puddings.\n\n- Worcestershire (or ; written abbreviation: Worcs) is a county in the West Midlands of England. Between 1974 and 1998, it was merged with the neighbouring county of Herefordshire as Hereford and Worcester.\n\n- Hereford and Worcester was an English county created on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 from the areas of the former administrative county of Herefordshire, most of Worcestershire (except Halesowen, Stourbridge and Warley, which became part of the West Midlands) and the county borough of Worcester. An aim of the Act was to increase efficiency of local government: the two counties are among England's smaller and less populous counties, particularly after the same Act transferred some of Worcestershire's most urbanised areas to the West Midlands. The merger aroused much opposition from Herefordshire people, many of whom regarded it as not a merger but a takeover by Worcestershire.\n\n- Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \"separators\". In many countries, cream is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. Cream can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets. Cream has high levels of saturated fat.\n\n- Corn starch, cornstarch, cornflour or maize starch or maize is the starch derived from the corn (maize) grain or wheat. The starch is obtained from the endosperm of the kernel. Corn starch is a popular food ingredient used in thickening sauces or soups, and is used in making corn syrup and other sugars.\n\n- Gelatin or gelatine (from meaning \"stiff\", \"frozen\") is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless food derived from collagen obtained from various animal raw materials. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceutical drugs, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called \"gelatinous\". Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis results in the reduction of protein fibrils into smaller peptides, which will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation, based on the process of hydrolysis. It is found in most gummy candy, as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin desserts, and some ice creams, dips, and yogurts. Gelatin for recipe use comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.\n\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\n\n- Worcester is a city in Worcestershire, England, southwest of Birmingham and north of Gloucester. The population is approximately 100,000. The River Severn flanks the western side of the city centre, which is overlooked by the 12th-century Worcester Cathedral.\n\n- In cooking, a sauce is liquid, cream, or semi-solid food served on or used in preparing other foods. Sauces are not normally consumed by themselves; they add flavor, moisture, and visual appeal to another dish. \"Sauce\" is a French word taken from the Latin \"salsa\", meaning \"salted\". Possibly the oldest recorded European sauce is garum, the fish sauce used by the Ancient Greeks; while doubanjiang, the Chinese soy bean paste is mentioned in \"Rites of Zhou\" in 3rd century BC.\n\n- Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose.\n\n- Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as an energy store. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods such as potatoes, wheat, maize (corn), rice, and cassava.\n\n- Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \"Vanilla\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\"V. planifolia\"). The word \"vanilla\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\"vaina\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \"little pod\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \"tlilxochitl\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.\n\n- A gel is a solid jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute cross-linked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinking within the fluid that gives a gel its structure (hardness) and contributes to the adhesive stick (tack). In this way gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid in which the solid is the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase. The word \"gel\" was coined by 19th-century Scottish chemist Thomas Graham by clipping from \"gelatine\".\n\n- Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.\n\n- Quiche is a savoury, open-faced pastry crust with a filling of savoury custard with one or more of cheese, meat, seafood or vegetables. Quiche can be served hot or cold. It is part of French cuisine but is also popular in other countries, particularly as party food.\n\n- Dessert is a course that concludes a main meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods and beverages, such as dessert wine or liqueurs, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.\n\n- Custard is a variety of culinary preparations based on a cooked mixture of milk or cream and egg yolk. Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (\"cr\u00e8me anglaise\") to a thick pastry cream (French: \"cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re\") used to fill \u00e9clairs. Most common custards are used as desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla. Custard bases may also be used for quiches and other savory foods. Sometimes flour, corn starch, or gelatin is added as in pastry cream or \"cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re\".\n\n- Malvern pudding is a traditional pudding from the English town of Malvern in Worcestershire . It is a baked dish made with apples or other seasonal fruit and custard although variations exist .

It stretches from Romania, Moldova through Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Xinjiang and Mongolia to Manchuria, with one major exclave located mostly in Hungary, the Puszta.\n\n- Qin Shi Huang (18 February 25910 September 210) was the founder of the Qin dynasty and was the first emperor of a unified China. He was born Ying Zheng or Zhao Zheng, a prince of the state of Qin. He became the King Zheng of Qin when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC. Rather than maintain the title of \"king\" borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers, he ruled as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty from 220 to 210 BC. His self-invented title \"emperor\" (\"\"), as indicated by his use of the word \"First\", would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia.\n\n- Qinhuangdao () is a port city on the coast of China located in northeastern Hebei province. It is administratively a prefecture-level city, located about east of Beijing, on the Bohai Sea, the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea. Its population during the 2010 national census was 2,987,605, with approximately one million people living in the built-up (\"or metro\") area made up of 3 urban districts.\n\n- Xiao'erjing or Xiao'erjin or Xiaor jin or in its shortened form, Xiaojing, literally meaning \"children's script\" or \"minor script\" (cf. \"original script\" referring to the original Perso-Arabic script, , Xiao'erjing: ; /Benjin), is the practice of writing Sinitic languages such as Mandarin (especially the Lanyin, Zhongyuan and Northeastern dialects) or the Dungan language in the Perso-Arabic Script. It is used on occasion by many ethnic minorities who adhere to the Islamic faith in China (mostly the Hui, but also the Dongxiang, and the Salar), and formerly by their Dungan descendants in Central Asia. Soviet writing reforms forced the Dungan to replace Xiao'erjing with a Roman alphabet and later a Cyrillic alphabet, which they continue to use up until today.\n\n- The Ming dynasty was the ruling dynasty of Chinathen known as the for 276 years (13681644) following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Ming, described by some as \"one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history,\" was the last imperial dynasty in China ruled by ethnic Han Chinese. Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng (who established the Shun dynasty, soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty), regimes loyal to the Ming throne  collectively called the Southern Ming  survived until 1683.\n\n- Shanhaiguan District, formerly Shan-hai-kwan or Shan-hai-kuan, is a district of the city of Qinhuangdao, Hebei province, People's Republic of China, named after the pass of the Great Wall within the district, Shanhai Pass. It is located east of the city centre.\n\n- Shanhai Pass, known in Chinese as Shanhaiguan (formerly Shan-hai-kwan or Shan-hai-kuan), also called Yu Pass, is one of the major passes in the Great Wall of China. The words \"First Pass Under Heaven\" are engraved above one of the gates, and so the site is also known by that name. It is located in Shanhaiguan District, Qinhuangdao, Hebei province.\n\n- Jiayu Pass or Jiayuguan ( simplified Chinese :  ; traditional Chinese :  ; pinyin : Jiy\u00f9 Gun ; literally : `` Excellent Valley Pass '' ) is the first pass at the west end of the Great Wall of China , near the city of Jiayuguan in Gansu province . Along with Juyong Pass and Shanhai Pass , it is one of the main passes of the Great Wall .\n\n- Fortifications are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin \"fortis\" (\"strong\") and \"facere\" (\"to make\").\n\n- The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century\u00a0BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220206\u00a0BC by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (13681644).\n\n- A mountain pass is a route through a mountain range or over a ridge. Since many of the world's mountain ranges have presented formidable barriers to travel, passes have been important since before recorded history, and have played a key role in trade, war, and migration. At lower elevations it may be called a hill pass. The highest pass is Mana Pass, located in the Himalayas on the border between India and China.\n\n- Juyong Pass is a mountain pass located in the Changping District of Beijing Municipality, over from central Beijing. The Great Wall of China passes through, and the Cloud Platform was built here in the year 1342.\n\n- Changping District, formerly Changping County, is a district situated in the suburbs of northwest Beijing.\n\n- Hebei (postal: Hopeh) is a province of China in the North China region. Its one-character abbreviation is \"\" (J\u00ec), named after Ji Province, a Han Dynasty province (\"zhou\") that included what is now southern Hebei. The name \"Hebei\" literally means \"north of the river\", referring to its location entirely to the north of the Huang He  (Yellow River).\n\n- Beijing (formerly romanised as Peking) is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the world's third most populous city proper. It is also one of the world's most populous capital cities. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighbouring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'jiayu pass' with the relationship of 'instance of'.\n\nChoices:\n- alphabet\n - biome\n - border\n - capital\n - capital region\n - census\n - character\n - chinese\n - city\n - coast\n - collapse\n - complex\n - country\n - district\n - dynasty\n - ecoregion\n - february\n - fell\n - government\n - history\n - humans\n - india\n - language\n - line\n - metropolitan\n - military\n - mountain\n - mountain pass\n - mountain range\n - population\n - port\n - port city\n - prefecture\n - province\n - province of china\n - rebellion\n - region\n - republic\n - river\n - role\n - script\n - september\n - series\n - state\n - steppe\n - three\n - throne\n - time\n - travel\n - two\n - variety\n - wall\n - word\n\n",

And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions.

If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The \u201cchoices\u201d of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the \u201cchoices\u201d of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a \u201cbackbone,\u201d from which the components\u2019 nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one\u2019s body, and are unique for each individual except identical twins.\n\n Choices:\n\n- mononucleus\n\n- mutation\n\n- variation\n\n- genetic\n\n\nA:",

If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda.\nPre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones.\nNo Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \"a distinguished Republican\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14.\nMoore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.\nQuestion: What does Trump think of the upcoming election?\nOptions:\n- not enough information \n - He is weary \n - He is worried \n - He is nervous\n===\nThe correct answer is\n",

Recycling programs not only increase energy use and pollution, but also cost more money than the disposal   of plain old garbage. Recycling may be the most wasteful activity in modern America.\"\nEnvironmental groups were quick to express their disagreement. They wrote reports on how recycling programs in cities can reduce pollution and cost less than regular garbage pickup and disposal. Michael Shapiro, an official of the US Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), said that \"recycling can be good value for money, although there's still room for improvements.\"\nBut in 2002, New York City, a pioneer of recycling, found that its recycling program was losing money, so it stopped glass and plastic recycling. Other major cities watched closely to see how New York was dealing with its remaining program (the city never stopped paper recycling). But then it closed its last landfill  , and private companies out of New York raised prices due to the increased workload of carrying away and disposing New York's garbage. As a result, glass and plastic recycling became profitable for the city again, and New York brought the program back.

Cornbread is used to soak up the ``pot liquor'', a nutrient-rich collard broth. Collard greens may also be thinly sliced and fermented to make a collard sauerkraut that is often cooked with flat dumplings. \nQuestion: are collard greens and turnip greens the same\nAnswer:",

Both have a similar taste, though collards tend to be more bitter than turnips \u2014 especially when eaten raw. The two also differ in appearance: Collard leaves grow on a thick stalk that is removed before cooking; Turnips have no stalks, but instead feature long stems with bright-green leaves growing at their base.\nSo the answer is No"

That sounds like a line straight out of a fantasy novel, but it's one hundred percent real life! It's an unusual  sight--a crowd of butterflies flying around the eyes of yellow-spotted river turtles, trying to get a little tear.s. The poor turtles try to avoid them, hut the butterflies insist drinking  their tears until they've had their fill.\nThe butterflies are likely attracted to the turtles' tears because the liquid drops contain  salt, specifically sodium, an important mineral that is rare in the western Amazon rainforest, said Phil Torres, a scientist who does much of his research at the Tambopata Research Center in Peru and is associated with Rice Univtrsity. Turtles get plenty of sodium  through their largely carnivorous  diet.  Meat contains significant levels of the salt, Torres told LiveScience. But herbivores  butterflies sometimes .struggle to get this extra mineral source, he added.\nTorres explained the western Amazon rainforest is lower in sodium than many places on earth, because it t is over l,000 miles away from the Atlantic Ocean---a main source of salt. The region is also cut off from the mineral dirt blown towards the west from the Andes Mountains. Most of these windblown minerals are removed from the air by the rain before they have a chance to reach the western Amazon.\nIn fact, the butterflies have other sources to get sodium besides turtles' tears, which include animal urine , muddy river banks, sweaty clothes and so on.\nPeople can't help wondering if the process is painful for turtles. Torres said it's not completely clear, but the teary effort probably has little effect on the turtles, other than perhaps making them more vulnerable to their enemies like big cats, since the butterflies can block out their vision.\nQuestion: What is the best title of the passage?\nOptions: A: Turtles' enemy or turtles' fiends?\nB: A line straight out of a fantasy novel\nC: The western Amazon rainforest's turtles\nD: Amazonian butterflies drinking turtle tears",

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \"Even worse, the golden...\n\nDecide whether \"There was new evidence that the plane was flown into the South China Sea\" is a valid answer to the following question: Why is it thought that the intensive search in the South China Sea was worthless?\nAnswer yes or no.",

Babies start to yawn even before they are born. The earliest yawn takes place when a baby is still inside its mother. When young children are about one year old, they start to yawn when they see others yawning. That's why scientists seem to think yawning is contagious.\nIt's no secret that yawning is contagious, but why do we yawn? Well, scientists are not really sure.\nSome think we yawn because we feel bored. Recently scientists studied two groups of students between the ages of 17 and 19. One group watched music videos, and the other watched a boring color test. Scientists compared the numbers of their yawns and found that the color test group yawned more times than the video group.\nAnother reason for yawning has to do with breathing. Some scientists believe that when we are bored or tired, we breathe more slowly. As our breathing slows down, we cannot get rid of  enough carbon dioxide, our bodies will tell the brains to breathe deeply. The result is a big yawn.\nIn 2007, scientists suggested a new reason. They said that the reason why people yawned was to cool down their brains. These scientists found that people who were warmer than others yawned more often.\nScientists are still trying to find out why yawning happens and why it is so contagious. But they are only sure that when one person yawns, almost everyone else nearby wants to yawn, too.\nAccording to the scientists, people start to yawn when they are   _  .\nA) born\nB) one year old\nC) 17 or 19 years old\nD) inside their mothers",

Must be beard free and exciting\") and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman \"Dinky\" Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", despite Elton John betting producer Muff Winwood that the song would not break into the charts.  Sparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of Melody Maker, Record Mirror and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", \"Amateur Hour\" and \"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\" led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops. Russell's hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron's expressionless squint and Charlie Chaplin-esque moustache.  Gordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the Kimono and Propaganda albums which had gained strong cult attention in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Flo & Eddie were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse WMMS in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as Kid Leo initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on American Bandstand in 1975 with host Dick Clark mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977.

Designated the Setsuko Ishiyama Director of Women's Basketball, VanDerveer led the Stanford Cardinal to two NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championships: in 1990 and 1992. She stepped away from the Stanford program for a year to serve as the U.S. national team head coach at the 1996 Olympic Games. VanDerveer is the 1990 Naismith National Coach of the Year and a ten-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year.\n\nAfter completing college, VanDerveer took a year off, with a plan to return to law school. When she ran out of money she returned home. When her parents realized she was doing little beyond playing chess and sleeping, they urged her to help with her sister Marie's basketball team. Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, as the girls did not take it seriously, but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.  VanDerveer sent out resumes to twenty schools, looking for a graduate assistant job, which is an unpaid position. She only got two responses, one of which was for Ohio State, where the athletic director had remembered her from Indiana. To prepare herself, she attended a coaching clinic taught by Knight. When she had attended his practices, she had stayed out of sight, but enrolled in a class, she followed her parents advice and sat up front. One of the coaches asked if she was lost. Knight embarrassed her with one of his questions, but she didn't stop attending, although she moved back a few rows. She was hired as an assistant coach to the varsity and the head coach of the JV.  In her first year, she coached the JV team to an 8-0 season. That caught the attention of Marianne Stanley at Old Dominion, who offered her an assistant coaching position. VanDerveer wanted to finish her master's degree, so accepted a paid position at Ohio State, at a salary less than a quarter of the Old Dominion offer.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did she help with her sister's basketball team?",

        "source": "Samuel Cook (January 22, 1931 - December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur. Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined The Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \"You Send Me\", \"Wonderful World\", \"Chain Gang\", and \"Twistin' the Night Away\".\n\nCooke was born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931. In 1957 he added an \"e\" at the end of his name to signify a new start to his life. He was the fifth of eight children of the Rev. Charles Cook, a minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and his wife, Annie Mae. One of his younger brothers, L.C. (1932-2017), later became a member of the doo-wop band Johnny Keyes and the Magnificents.  The family moved to Chicago in 1933. Cooke attended Doolittle Elementary and Wendell Phillips Academy High School in Chicago, the same school that Nat \"King\" Cole had attended a few years earlier. Sam Cooke began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old. He first became known as lead singer with the Highway QC's when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14. During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor Lou Rawls, who sang in a rival gospel group.  In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor R. H. Harris as lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, founded by Harris, who had signed with Specialty Records on behalf of the group. Their first recording under Cooke's leadership was the song \"Jesus Gave Me Water\" in 1951. They also recorded the gospel songs \"Peace in the Valley\", \"How Far Am I from Canaan?\", \"Jesus Paid the Debt\" and \"One More River\", among many others, some of which he wrote. Cooke was often credited for bringing gospel music to the attention of a younger crowd of listeners, mainly girls who would rush to the stage when the Soul Stirrers hit the stage just to get a glimpse of Cooke.\n\nDid he have any famous songs in his career?",

        "source": "Answer by taking a quote from the following article:\n\nDunham was born in Dallas, Texas on April 18, 1962. When he was three months old, he was adopted by real estate appraiser Howard Dunham, and his homemaker wife Joyce, who raised him in a devoutly Presbyterian household in an affluent Dallas neighborhood, as an only child. He began ventriloquism in 1970 at age eight, when his parents gave him a Mortimer Snerd dummy for Christmas, and an accompanying how-to album. The next day he checked out a how-to book on ventriloquism from the library, and explained in 2011 that he still had it, remarking that he was \"a thief in the third grade\".\n\nOn July 18, 2003, Dunham appeared on Comedy Central Presents, his first solo appearance on Comedy Central. During his half hour piece, he showcased Jose Jalapeno on a Stick, Walter, an early version of Melvin the Superhero Guy and Peanut, whom Dunham had begun to merchandise into a line of dolls. The appearance was successful, but Comedy Central resisted giving Dunham more airtime, feeling that he was not a good fit for them. By 2005 Dunham decided to gamble on financing his own comedy DVD, Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself, which was taped in Santa Ana, California. Dunham's manager, Judi Brown-Marmel, lobbied the network to air it, pointing to Dunham's drawing power and merchandising profits, and arguing that the network needed more diverse content. Surprised by the high ratings of the first Blue Collar Comics concert movie that same year, the network began to reconsider its brand. In late 2006, Comedy Central aired Arguing with Myself, drawing two million viewers when it aired, and selling two million DVDs.  In 2007, Dunham appeared as The Amazing Ken with Jose Jalapeno on a Stick in the Larry the Cable Guy feature film Delta Farce. His second special, Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity, was taped at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. that same year. It served not only to cement Dunham's stardom, but to introduce his most controversial character, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, which became a viral Internet sensation. A clip of Achmed from Insanity attracted over 140 million hits on YouTube, making it the ninth most watched clip on that website as of October 2009.  By 2008, Dunham's characters had crossed language barriers, with his specials dubbed for audiences in various countries such as France, and Dunham attracting requests for performances in South Africa, Australia, Norway, Denmark, China, and the Middle East. Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special was taped at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that same year, and premiered on Comedy Central on November 16, 2008, watched by 6.6 million people. It became available on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2008. The special's premiere was the highest rated telecast in Comedy Central's history.  In September 2008, his career reached new heights as he began performing in arenas filled with tens of thousands of people. Dunham was somewhat wary of such large venues, but adapted by adjusting the timing of his often rapid exchanges with the puppets so that audience members farthest from the stage could have time to react.  In addition to his comedy specials, Dunham also released his first music album, Don't Come Home for Christmas, on November 4, 2008. It contains original Christmas songs as well as a parody of \"Jingle Bells\" by Achmed entitled \"Jingle Bombs\". All the songs, with the exception of \"Jingle Bombs\", were written and accompanied by Brian Haner, who joined Dunham's act as \"Guitar Guy\". His first onscreen appearance was in Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special.\n\nHow did it fair?",

He was educated at La Martiniere Calcutta, and the St. Xavier's College of the University of Calcutta. His parents were both sports persons. Vece was a midfielder in the bronze medal-winning Indian field hockey team at the 1972 Munich Olympics.\nContext: Paes started his Davis Cup career in 1990 at the age of 16, when he partnered Zeeshan Ali in doubles to beat the Japanese team in a gruelling five-set encounter. He is considered one of the top Davis cup players for his country, with a record of 89-32 overall, as of July 2015. He played an important role in the Indian Davis cup team that reached the World Group from 1991-1998. He was part of the Indian Davis Cup team that reached the semifinals of the 1993 Davis Cup with wins against Switzerland and France, eventually losing to Australia. In singles, his major wins came against French duo of Arnaud Boetsch and Henri Leconte in Frejus, France in 1993, Wayne Ferreira in 1994, and Goran Ivanisevic in 1995 when India defeated Croatia, Jan Siemerink in 1995 to defeat Netherlands, and Jiri Novak in 1997. He teamed up with Bhupathi to beat Hirszon and Ivanisevic of Croatia in 1995, Martin Damm and Petr Korda of the Czech Republic in 1997, Nicolas Massu and Marcelo Rios of Chile in 1997, Broad and Tim Henman in 1998, and Simon Aspelin and Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden in 2005. In 2007, Leander has three wins (two doubles and one singles) and no losses in the Davis Cup.  In 1993, ranked No. 197, he lost to No. 238 Fernon Wibierin the first round of qualifying at Wimbledon. Three weeks later he beat No. 25 Arnaud Boetsch on clay in straight sets in the Davis Cup. He also defeated Henri Leconte in the same week and even though Ramesh Krishnan closed the tie out by beating Rodolphe Gilbert in a five-setter, the architect of that victory was Paes.  In 1994, ranked No 143, he lost in the first round of a Challenger to No 208 Louis Gloria. Four weeks later, he beat World No. 13 Wayne Ferreira in straight sets in the Davis Cup.  In 1995, ranked No 130, he managed to beat Croatia's World No 7 Goran Ivanisevic (1992 and 1994 Wimbledon singles finalist) in a controversial five-setter on grass.

        "source": "Background: Amy Marcy Cheney Beach (September 5, 1867 - December 27, 1944) was an American composer and pianist. She was the first successful American female composer of large-scale art music. Her \"Gaelic\" Symphony, premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. She was one of the first American composers to succeed without the benefit of European training, and one of the most respected and acclaimed American composers of her era.\nContext: A major compositional success came with her Mass in E-flat major, which was performed in 1892 by the Handel and Haydn Society orchestra, which since its foundation in 1815 had never performed a piece composed by a woman. Newspaper music critics responded to the Mass by declaring Beach one of America's foremost composers, comparing the piece to Masses by Cherubini and Bach.  Beach followed this up with an important milestone in music history: her Gaelic Symphony, the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. It premiered October 30, 1896, performed by the Boston Symphony \"with exceptional success,\" although \"whatever the merits or defects of the symphony were thought to be, critics went to extraordinary lengths in their attempts to relate them to the composer's sex.\" Composer George Whitefield Chadwick (1854-1931) wrote to Beach that he and his colleague Horatio Parker (1863-1919) had attended the Gaelic Symphony's premiere and much enjoyed it: \"I always feel a thrill of pride myself whenever I hear a fine work by any of us, and as such you will have to be counted in, whether you [like it] or not - one of the boys.\" These \"boys\" were a group of composers unofficially known as the Second New England School, and included not only Chadwick and Parker but also John Knowles Paine (1839-1926), Arthur Foote (1853-1937), and Edward MacDowell (1860-1908). With the addition of Beach, they collectively became known as the Boston Six, of whom Beach was the youngest.  In 1900, the Boston Symphony premiered Beach's Piano Concerto, with the composer as soloist. It has been suggested that the piece suggests Beach's struggles against her mother and husband for control of her musical life.\nQuestion: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?.

        "source": "Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \"Bill\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \"botanic physician\" and sold elixirs.\n\nIn 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised $4,000 ($108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \"God gave me money\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\"  At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.  In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \"The Flats\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed.  While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.  In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \"critical\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for $72,500 (equivalent to $1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \"It was the day that determined my career.\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.\n\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did his business do well during the War period?",

He played as a split end and spent his entire eleven-year professional career with the Green Bay Packers. Under head coach Curly Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three: 1936, 1939, and 1944.\n\nHutson has been honored in a variety of ways. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1951, and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1968, also as an initial member. His number 14 was the first number retired by the Packers, in a public ceremony at a game at City Stadium on December 2, 1951. Hutson Street in the Packerland Industrial Park in Green Bay is named for him, and in 1994 the Packers named their new state-of-the-art indoor practice facility across the street from Lambeau Field the \"Don Hutson Center.\"  Hutson was inducted as a charter member of both the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951, and Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. His college career made him a unanimous choice for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1920-1969 era. Hutson is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, inducted in 1972 along with his quarterbacks, Arnie Herber and Cecil Isbell. There is a park named after him in his hometown of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. On the occasion of his 75th birthday he performed the ceremonial coin toss of Super Bowl XXII to end the pregame ceremonies. Hutson was named to the NFL's 1930s All-Decade Team and 50th Anniversary Team in 1970, and in 1994 he was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked sixth on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking Packer and the highest-ranking pre-World War II player. In 2012, the NFL Network named Hutson the greatest Green Bay Packer of all time.  In 2005, the Flagstad family of Green Bay donated to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame an authentic Packers No. 14 jersey worn by Hutson. The jersey was found in a trunk of old uniforms in 1946 at the Rockwood Lodge, the Packers' summer training camp from 1946 to 1949, owned by Melvin and Helen Flagstad. The jersey, a rare NFL artifact valued at over $17,000, was donated by son Daniel Flagstad in memory of his parents.  Hutson's most productive seasons were from 1942 to 1945, a time in which the NFL was severely depleted with many of its most talented players and prospective college athletes serving in the military during World War II. Hutson was classified I-A for the military draft, but had three daughters, so was able to avoid conscription. On the notion that Hutson exploited watered-down defenses, former Packers running back Paul Hornung responded as such: \"I'm a believer. Am I a believer! You know what Hutson would do in this league today? The same things he did when he played.\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\n\nDid he do anything for the community?",

        "source": "Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 - December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. Although the surgery was partially successful in controlling his epilepsy, a severe side effect was that he became unable to form new memories. H.M. was widely studied from late 1957 until his death in 2008. His case played an important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes.\n\nThe study of Molaison revolutionized the understanding of the organization of human memory. It has provided broad evidence for the rejection of old theories and the formation of new theories on human memory, in particular about its processes and the underlying neural structures (cf. Kolb & Whishaw, 1996). In the following, some of the major insights are outlined.  Molaison's brain was the subject of an anatomical study funded by the Dana Foundation and the National Science Foundation. The aim of the project, headed by Jacopo Annese, of The Brain Observatory at UC San Diego, was to provide a complete microscopic survey of the entire brain to reveal the neurological basis of Molaison's historical memory impairment at cellular resolution. On December 4, 2009, Annese's group acquired 2401 brain slices, with only two damaged slices and 16 potentially problematic slices. The digital 3D reconstruction of his brain was finished at the beginning of 2014.  The results of the study were published in Nature Communications for January 2014. The researchers found, to their surprise, that half of H.M.'s hippocampus had survived the 1953 surgery, which has deep implications on past and future interpretations of H.M.'s neurobehavioral profile and of the previous literature describing H.M. as a 'pure' hippocampus lesion patient. Additionally, a previously unexpected discrete lesion was discovered in the prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest revisiting raw data from behavioral testing. A three-dimensional virtual model of the brain allowed the dynamics of the surgery to be reconstructed; it was found that the brain damage above the left orbit could have been created by Dr. Scoville when he lifted the frontal lobe to reach into the medial temporal lobes.  The article also describes the general neuropathological state of the brain via multiple imaging modalities. As H.M. was 82 when he died, his brain had aged considerably. Several pathological features were discovered, some severe, which had contributed to his cognitive decline.  The digital atlas of HM's brain was made publicly available on the Internet free of charge; its \"permanence on the web relies on contributions from users\".\n\nAsk a question about this article.",

Thus, an answer representing these facts could fit well within the context:\nWas there anything else interesting they learned?"

        "source": "Womack was born and raised in Jacksonville, Texas. At an early age, she was interested in country music. Her father, a disc jockey, often took his daughter to work with him to help choose records to play on the air. Womack was the second of two daughters.\n\nShe released her third studio album in 2000 entitled, I Hope You Dance, which was met with major success. The title track (which was released as the lead single), reached No. 1 on the Billboard Country chart for five weeks and crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100, becoming a major crossover Pop hit, reaching No. 14. It also peaked at the top spot on the adult contemporary chart and even reached the UK Singles Charts, peaking at No. 40. Both of Womack's daughters appeared in the song's video that year. Towards the end of 2000, \"I Hope You Dance\" won the Country Music Association's \"Song of the Year\" and \"Single of the Year\" awards. With the Pop success of \"I Hope You Dance,\" Womack drew the attention of the magazines People and Time, both of which praised the single, calling it \"one of her best.\" The song later won awards in 2001 from the Grammy and Academy of Country music awards. The album of the same name has sold 3 million copies in the United States to date. The album's follow-up single, a cover of Rodney Crowell's \"Ashes by Now\" peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Country Chart. The third single, \"Why They Call it Falling\" was also successful, reaching the country Top 15.  On December 11, 2000, Womack performed \"I Hope You Dance\" at the annual Nobel Peace Prize concert. This song was also featured in the 2008 Tyler Perry film entitled \"The Family that Preys.\"  In 2002, Womack's fourth studio album, Something Worth Leaving Behind was released. The album made a stronger attempt at a pop-flavored style, however it did not react well, leading to poor record sales and only one major hit. Following its release, Womack's career stalled. Later that year, she released a Christmas album, The Season for Romance and also collaborated with Willie Nelson on his single, \"Mendocino County Line,\" which won a Grammy and Country Music award in 2002. In early 2003, she got a small recurring role on the popular CBS drama, The District.  In 2004, Womack performed \"I Hope You Dance\" at the Republican National Convention, in which George W. Bush was nominated for his second term as President of the United States. The other performers that night included Sara Evans and Larry Gatlin. She also collaborated with Red Dirt Music band Cross Canadian Ragweed on their hit \"Sick and Tired\" in 2004. Also that year, she also released her first Greatest Hits album, which included two new songs; \"The Wrong Girl\" (the only song from the album released as a single) and \"Time for Me to Go.\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article:\n\ndid it make the charts?",

        "source": "Urlacher was born to Bradley and Lavoyda Urlacher in Pasco, Washington, and his parents raised him with his younger brother Casey. After his parents separated, Lavoyda raised Urlacher and his siblings in Lovington, New Mexico. He spent his youth immersed in sports, and developed an interest in football, basketball, track and later table tennis; he graduated from Lovington High School in 1996. While his mother worked several jobs to keep her family afloat, Urlacher spent his teenage years playing sports for Lovington High School and training in weight rooms.\n\nUrlacher enrolled at the University of New Mexico, majored in criminology, and played for the New Mexico Lobos football team. The Lobos' head coach, Dennis Franchione, converted Urlacher to linebacker, but often left him on the sidelines in favor of more experienced players. The team finished with winning records during Urlacher's first two years and even made a trip to the 1997 Insight.com Bowl. The team's success prompted Franchione to leave New Mexico in favor of Texas Christian University. His departure prompted the school to hire Rocky Long, a former coach at UCLA.  Urlacher flourished under Long's tenure. Urlacher not only received more playing time, but also played a more versatile role on both offense and defense. Long converted Urlacher into a \"Lobo-Back\", a cross between a linebacker and free safety, and placed him in a 3-3-5 defense scheme. He spent significant time training with the team's defensive coordinator, Bronco Mendenhall, who helped Urlacher refine his skills as a defensive back. Long also used Urlacher as a return specialist and wide receiver throughout his final two years with the Lobos. Despite Long's extensive changes to the team's roster, formations, and work ethic, the Lobos' performance declined. However, Urlacher became one of the team's most productive players during this time. He finished his career with 442 tackles, three interceptions, 11 sacks, and 11 forced fumbles. Outside of defense, he caught six touchdown passes, and returned five kicks for touchdowns.  After the 1999 season, he was one of the finalists for the Jim Thorpe Award, and finished twelfth on the Heisman Trophy ballot. Urlacher received All-American honors from Walter Camp, Football Writers Association of America, and the Associated Press. He played his final collegiate game at the 2000 Senior Bowl, where he was one of the game's top players. Urlacher led the nation with 178 tackles during his junior year, and also set a school record for most tackles in a single season. He finished with the third most career tackles in the University of New Mexico's history. The school has honored Urlacher on several occasions. They awarded him with the Male Athlete of the Year Award in 2000, and held a special halftime ceremony to honor his success in 2006. Urlacher was also the first person to be inducted into the University of New Mexico's Football Wall of Fame. On November 9, 2013, during halftime of New Mexico's game against Air Force, the school retired Urlacher's No. 44 jersey. Urlacher was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame on December 5, 2017.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he win any other awards?",

The match-up between the Bills and Patriots was highly anticipated in the week before the meeting. Both teams had won their first games of the new season and high expectations for the season ahead were falling on both teams, including the host team, who were led by new head coach and old Patriots' foe Rex Ryan (formerly of the New York Jets). The Guinness Book of World Records was invited to Ralph Wilson Stadium to see if the Bills' fans could break the decibel record for crowd noise that was set at Arrowhead Stadium by Kansas City Chiefs' fans in the season prior (coincidentally in a game that the Patriots also featured in as the away team). In a heated game-day atmosphere, the Bills took the opening kickoff and drove the ball 80-yards in ten plays, with rookie running back Karlos Williams scoring on a 2-yard run. Two possessions later, the Patriots, aided by completions of 16 and 36 yards to Aaron Dobson and Gronkowski respectively, raced 62 yards in only 5 plays, with Julian Edelman catching an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady. After another Bills three-and-out, aided by a 28-yard punt return to the Bills 27 by Danny Amendola coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on the Bills, the Patriots need just two plays to go 13 yards and score on a 6-yard touchdown run by Dion Lewis, taking a 14-7 lead. On the ensuing Bills' drive, Tyrod Taylor was intercepted by Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, who returned it 9 yards to the Bills 30. The Patriots then marched 30 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 21-7. After a Bills punt, from the Bills 48, Lewis caught a 6-yard pass, but was stripped by Paul Brown with Corey Graham returning it 29 yards to the Patriots 33, but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved them back to the 48. After being forced to punt, the Patriots drove to the Bills 48, but on 4th-and-1 Brady fired an incomplete pass. The Bills finally scored again, racing 48 yards in four penalty marred plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay, trimming the deficit to 21-13, after a missed PAT. The Patriots drove to the Bills 28 on their next drive and Stephen Gostkowski converted a 46-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. The Bills advanced the ball to the 50-yard line on the next drive, but Taylor was intercepted by Harmon a deep pass intended for wide receiver Sammy Watkins with 16 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee on the ensuing drive, with the Patriots going into the half leading 24-13. The Patriots drove 77 yards on the opening drive, all the way to the Bills 3-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making the score 27-13. After a Bills punt, the Patriots raced 83 yards in 9 plays, with Brady capping off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to a diving Edelman, growing the lead to 34-13. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Bills 32 and Gostkowski upping the lead to 37-13 on a 50-yard field goal. As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19.  The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins.

The famous eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500. The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one. Vesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of lahar were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929, and 1944.\n\nQuestion about the article:",

The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376. Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377; he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II , who was still a child. The treaty at Br\u00e9tigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France; however, a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais and a few other coastal cities. It was usual to appoint a regent in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377. However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, although Gaunt remained highly influential. Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384-1385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: Who died first, Edward III or the Black Prince?",

Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty.

Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M).

Since PersonY's contagiousness may reflect on others' opinion of them and therefore also affect how they see their friend (PersonX), this could be considered a strengthener for our original hypothesis."

Since I was scared of them, and no one would listen to me alone, I gave the information to another larger company, AC.\n\nAC excitedly went public with the information. He became popular, and had a huge influx of customers. Due to a mistake, it came out that I was the leak. No big deal, we rolled with it, I had a minor increase in my own customers, nothing major. We communicated regularly, until it became clear we had strong romantic feelings for one another. I cut it off, because he is married with children. \n\nA week or so later, I spoke to a supplier who used to work bad supplier. He knew about the damaged goods, but was afraid. He thanked me for going public, and offers me a discount on his newest product. I place an order.\n\nA few days later, AC insisted that we talk on the phone. I explained my feelings were too raw, so talking would only cause more pain since a relationship was impossible. I told him i couldn't go to his store because I still loved him. He said we would talk when I was ready, and to know he would always love me.\n\nDays later my order from the new supplier arrived. I put up the product for sale. The next day, AC released a statement, denouncing me for selling the product, accusing me of using him to get more customers, being part of a conspiracy to take him down, and of manipulating his feelings to get what I want. He also says I played a \"cat and mouse game\", and suddenly stopped talking to him and shopping at his store for no reason. \n\nI was shocked and devastated. I told him he betrayed me by attacking my character. He said he understood and blocked me.\n\nAfterwards, I was contacted by various friends and strangers asking if I was ok. They felt AC was out of line. I heard from everyone except FF.\n\nFF has developed a reputation. He uses people to get access to premium suppliers, help setting up his store, etc. As a friend, I had helped FF with many things, he used my connections to BC AND AC to get new customers and suppliers. I ignored it, because I considered FF a good friend.\n\n1 day after the drama? Nothing from FF. 2 days? Nothing. 3 days after, I finally asked FF if they saw it. Answer? Yes, and they had nothing to say, because they are friends with everyone. Everyone fucked up. FF is so upset with everyone for doing this!\n\nI told FF I was hurt, they didnt even seem to care about the effect on me, and that at least some support would be great. FF then tells me he plans to write an ENTIRE NEWSLETTER promoting AC.\n\nI told FF and his wife, if they write the newsletter, I am done working with them. We have a company together. It would look like they are condoning the actions of AC. As my business partners, I felt that looked bad.

I have been with my wife for 3 years now I love my wife, she is with out a doubt \"the one\". \n\nShe has a group of friends that she grew up with and went to middle and high school with and she still has remained good friends with a lot of them. I think they are a wonderful group of people and generally everytime we get together it's a great time. They are a very welcoming and hospitable group and I had no problem falling in on friendly terms with a lot of them. The majority are over/out for dinner monthly.\n\nI have slowly started to notice that almost everytime we get together a subject (almost always jokingly brought up) is another one of our friends ( let's call him Jeff ) who has a, as some have referred to it \" the biggest dick they have ever seen\" \"not big, like freakishly huge\" \"you have your regular virginity, then your Jeff virginity\" type of endowment. \n\nThat being said it just seems like everyone in this group has some kinda fetish-worship about this guy and his hog, like I mentioned before, the jokes and stories they all share about different times they themselves have had sex with Jeff, or times they walked in on Jeff having sex with someone. I pointed this out to my wife after dinner Saturday about the cult like worship and her response was. \" I mean it is freakishly huge *laughs*\"\n\nMy problem with a lot of this is more complex than the way that everyone seems to obsessively talk about this guys hog. Some of it stems from the fact that my wife had a \"FWB\" relationship with him for a few years. ( 10 years ago, long before I ever met her) A lot of it I feel comes from the fact that everyone is comfortable OPENLY discussing this man's sex life.\nMaybe this is where I start to sound prude or like a baby but I don't openly discuss the kinds of kink my wife and I are into. I feel like everyone just being so nonchalant about discussing the first time they saw Jeff naked or the first time they saw Jeff fucking some random chick at a party is just.... too much\n\nThe whole thing just feels weird to me, with all of the different factors adding up, sometimes it just makes me reluctant to even agree to go out to dinner because at the end of the night regardless of where we go or what we do at some point this subject is going to be brought up and yet again I'm going to be forced to either confront the idea that my wife had sex with this guy for years or ignore it.\n\nI have tried to talk to my wife about it but at the end of the day, if the tables got turned I don't see any of it happening much less being so accepted.

Following SonoVue administration different perfusion phases could be identified: early (0-1min), mid (1-4min) and late (4-6min) phases. In the early phase, CEUS identified 91.1% of malignant tumors characterized by a claw-shaped enhancement, while 83.9% of benign tumors had a homogeneous enhancement, with a statistically significant difference between the two enhancement patterns (chi(2)=43.16, P<0.01). Moreover, contrast medium persistence in the late phase was helpful in the identification of benign and malignant tumors (chi(2)=46.88, P<0.01): contrast medium was present in 88.9% of malignant tumors, while in only 9.7% of the benign tumors. The study showed that various parametric imaging color maps for peak intensity and time to peak were mostly suggestive of malignancy, while quite uniform peak intensity and time to peak of color maps were the characteristic of benign tumors.

Provisionally called Memory, screenwriter Ronald Shusett collaborated with O'Bannon on the project, adding elements from a previous O'Bannon script, Gremlins, which featured gremlins causing mayhem aboard a World War II bomber. The duo finished the script, initially titled Star Beast\u00a0\u2014 it was changed to Alien after O'Bannon noticed the number of times the word \"alien\" occurred in the script. Their script was sold to Brandywine Productions, which had a distribution deal with 20th Century Fox. The writers anticipated a low-budget film, but 20th Century Fox was inclined to invest millions, thanks to the success of Star Wars. The original script featured an all-male crew, including Ripley character, with Tom Skerritt attached, with the caveat that the roles were interchangeable for men or women. When Fox president Alan Ladd Jr. and the producers at Brandywine were made aware of Fox working on other titles with strong female leads, Skerritt was cast as Captain Dallas and Ripley was recast with Veronica Cartwright, before director Ridley Scott opted for Sigourney Weaver shortly before filming.\n Link Information: \n\nDark Star is a 1974 American science fiction comedy film directed by John Carpenter Question: Who directed the Dark Star?",

Your questions can be extractive, abstractive, or yes-no questions.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction\nOur probing methodology starts by constructing challenge datasets (Figure FIGREF1, yellow box) from a target set of knowledge resources. Each of our probing datasets consists of multiple-choice questions that include a question $\\textbf {q}$ and a set of answer choices or candidates $\\lbrace a_{1},...a_{N}\\rbrace $. This section describes in detail the 5 different datasets we build, which are drawn from two sources of expert knowledge, namely WordNet BIBREF35 and the GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English (GCIDE). We describe each resource in turn, and explain how the resulting dataset probes, which we call WordNetQA and DictionaryQA, are constructed.\n\nFor convenience, we will describe each source of expert knowledge as a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. The nodes of this graph are $\\mathcal {V} = \\mathcal {C} \\cup \\mathcal {W} \\cup \\mathcal {S} \\cup \\mathcal {D}$, where $\\mathcal {C}$ is a set of atomic concepts, $\\mathcal {W}$ a set of words, $\\mathcal {S}$ a set of sentences, and $\\mathcal {D}$ a set of definitions (see Table TABREF4 for details for WordNet and GCIDE). Each edge of $G$ is directed from an atomic concept in $\\mathcal {C}$ to another node in $V$, and is labeled with a relation, such as hypernym or isa$^\\uparrow $, from a set of relations $\\mathcal {R}$ (see Table TABREF4).\n\nWhen defining our probe question templates, it will be useful to view $G$ as a set of (relation, source, target) triples $\\mathcal {T} \\subseteq \\mathcal {R} \\times \\mathcal {C} \\times \\mathcal {V}$. Due to their origin in an expert knowledge source, such triples preserve semantic consistency. For instance, when the relation in a triple is def, the corresponding edge maps a concept in $\\mathcal {C}$ to a definition in $\\mathcal {D}$.\n\nTo construct probe datasets, we rely on two heuristic functions, defined below for each individual probe: $\\textsc {gen}_{\\mathcal {Q}}(\\tau )$, which generates gold question-answer pairs $(\\textbf {q},\\textbf {a})$ from a set of triples $\\tau \\subseteq \\mathcal {T}$ and question templates $\\mathcal {Q}$, and $\\textsc {distr}(\\tau ^{\\prime })$, which generates distractor answers choices $\\lbrace a^{\\prime }_{1},...a^{\\prime }_{N-1} \\rbrace $ based on another set of triples $\\tau ^{\\prime }$ (where usually $\\tau \\subset \\tau ^{\\prime }$). For brevity, we will use $\\textsc {gen}(\\tau )$ to denote $\\textsc {gen}_{\\mathcal {Q}}(\\tau )$, leaving question templates $\\mathcal {Q}$ implicit.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA\nWordNet is an English lexical database consisting of around 117k concepts, which are organized into groups of synsets that each contain a gloss (i.e., a definition of the target concept), a set of representative English words (called lemmas), and, in around 33k synsets, example sentences. In addition, many synsets have ISA links to other synsets that express complex taxonomic relations. Figure FIGREF6 shows an example and Table TABREF4 summarizes how we formulate WordNet as a set of triples $\\mathcal {T}$ of various types. These triples together represent a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. Our main motivation for using WordNet, as opposed to a resource such as ConceptNet BIBREF36, is the availability of glosses ($\\mathcal {D}$) and example sentences ($\\mathcal {S}$), which allows us to construct natural language questions that contextualize the types of concepts we want to probe.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Example Generation @!START@$\\textsc {gen}(\\tau )$@!END@.\nWe build 4 individual datasets based on semantic relations native to WordNet (see BIBREF37): hypernymy (i.e., generalization or ISA reasoning up a taxonomy, ISA$^\\uparrow $), hyponymy (ISA$^{\\downarrow }$), synonymy, and definitions. To generate a set of questions in each case, we employ a number of rule templates $\\mathcal {Q}$ that operate over tuples. A subset of such templates is shown in Table TABREF8. The templates were designed to mimic naturalistic questions we observed in our science benchmarks.\n\nFor example, suppose we wish to create a question $\\textbf {q}$ about the definition of a target concept $c \\in \\mathcal {C}$. We first select a question template from $\\mathcal {Q}$ that first introduces the concept $c$ and its lemma $l \\in \\mathcal {W}$ in context using the example sentence $s \\in \\mathcal {S}$, and then asks to identify the corresponding WordNet gloss $d \\in \\mathcal {D}$, which serves as the gold answer $\\textbf {a}$. The same is done for ISA reasoning; each question about a hypernym/hyponym relation between two concepts $c \\rightarrow ^{\\uparrow /\\downarrow } c^{\\prime } \\in \\mathcal {T}_{i}$ (e.g., $\\texttt {dog} \\rightarrow ^{\\uparrow /\\downarrow } \\texttt {animal/terrier}$) first introduces a context for $c$ and then asks for an answer that identifies $c^{\\prime }$ (which is also provided with a gloss so as to contain all available context).\n\nIn the latter case, the rules $(\\texttt {isa}^{r},c,c^{\\prime }) \\in \\mathcal {T}_i$ in Table TABREF8 cover only direct ISA links from $c$ in direction $r \\in \\lbrace \\uparrow ,\\downarrow \\rbrace $. In practice, for each $c$ and direction $r$, we construct tests that cover the set HOPS$(c,r)$ of all direct as well as derived ISA relations of $c$:\n\nThis allows us to evaluate the extent to which models are able to handle complex forms of reasoning that require several inferential steps or hops.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Distractor Generation: @!START@$\\textsc {distr}(\\tau ^{\\prime })$@!END@.\nAn example of how distractors are generated is shown in Figure FIGREF6, which relies on similar principles as above. For each concept $c$, we choose 4 distractor answers that are close in the WordNet semantic space. For example, when constructing hypernymy tests for $c$ from the set hops$(c,\\uparrow )$, we build distractors by drawing from $\\textsc {hops}(c,\\downarrow )$ (and vice versa), as well as from the $\\ell $-deep sister family of $c$, defined as follows. The 1-deep sister family is simply $c$'s siblings or sisters, i.e., the other children $\\tilde{c} \\ne c$ of the parent node $c^{\\prime }$ of $c$. For $\\ell > 1$, the $\\ell $-deep sister family also includes all descendants of each $\\tilde{c}$ up to $\\ell -1$ levels deep, denoted $\\textsc {hops}_{\\ell -1}(\\tilde{c},\\downarrow )$. Formally:\n\nFor definitions and synonyms we build distractors from all of these sets (with a similar restriction on the depth of sister distractors as noted above). In doing this, we can systematically investigate model performance on a wide range of distractor sets.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Perturbations and Semantic Clusters\nBased on how we generate data, for each concept $c$ (i.e., atomic WordNet synset) and probe type (i.e., definitions, hypernymy, etc.), we have a wide variety of questions related to $c$ that manipulate 1) the complexity of reasoning that is involved (e.g., the number of inferential hops) and; 2) the types of distractors (or distractor perturbations) that are employed. We call such sets semantic clusters. As we describe in the next section, semantic clusters allow us to devise new types of evaluation that reveal whether models have comprehensive and consistent knowledge of target concepts (e.g., evaluating whether a model can correctly answer several questions associated with a concept, as opposed to a few disjoint instances).\n\nDetails of the individual datasets are shown in Table TABREF12. From these sets, we follow BIBREF22 in allocating a maximum of 3k examples for training and reserve the rest for development and testing. Since we are interested in probing, having large held-out sets allows us to do detailed analysis and cluster-based evaluation.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: DictionaryQA\nThe DictionaryQA dataset is created from the GCIDE dictionary, which is a comprehensive open-source English dictionary built largely from the Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary BIBREF38. Each entry consists of a word, its part-of-speech, its definition, and an optional example sentence (see Table TABREF14). Overall, 33k entries (out of a total of 155k) contain example sentences/usages. As with the WordNet probes, we focus on this subset so as to contextualize each word being probed. In contrast to WordNet, GCIDE does not have ISA relations or explicit synsets, so we take each unique entry to be a distinct sense. We then use the dictionary entries to create a probe that centers around word-sense disambiguation, as described below.\n\nDataset Probes and Construction ::: DictionaryQA ::: Example and Distractor Generation.\nTo generate gold questions and answers, we use the same generation templates for definitions exemplified in Figure TABREF8 for WordNetQA. To generate distractors, we simply take alternative definitions for the target words that represent a different word sense (e.g., the alternative definitions of gift shown in Table TABREF14), as well as randomly chosen definitions if needed to create a 5-way multiple choice question. As above, we reserve a maximum of 3k examples for training. Since we have only 9k examples in total in this dataset (see WordSense in Table TABREF12), we also reserve 3k each for development and testing.\n\nWe note that initial attempts to build this dataset through standard random splitting gave rise to certain systematic biases that were exploited by the choice-only baseline models described in the next section, and hence inflated overall model scores. After several efforts at filtering we found that, among other factors, using definitions from entries without example sentences as distractors (e.g., the first two entries in Table TABREF14) had a surprising correlation with such biases. This suggests that possible biases involving differences between dictionary entries with and without examples can taint the resulting automatically generated MCQA dataset (for more discussion on the pitfalls involved with automatic dataset construction, see Section SECREF5).",

By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to take an interest in the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War II.",

This, he claims, is because the sourdough yeast cultivates a culture of friendly bacteria and an acid environment, all of which become natural preservatives. My experience seems to confirm this.Bread recipes containing egg, oil or milk tend to keep for longer than those without.As @SAJ14SAJ says, bread freezes very well. Loss of flavour in the freezer is not a commonly recognised phenomenon.One option is to slice a loaf of bread, bag it and freeze it. Take as many slices as you need at a time. It will defrost very quickly at room temperature, due to its low mass and high surface area.Another option is to make rolls, part-bake, and freeze.

The Arundells were an ancient and prominent Cornish family, the principal branches of which were seated at the manors of Lanherne, Trerice, Tolverne and Menadarva in Cornwall. The family held several estates in Wiltshire. The castle was confiscated when Sir Thomas \u2014 a staunch Roman Catholic \u2014 was executed for treason in 1552, but in 1570 was bought back by his son, Sir Matthew Arundell, later a Sheriff and Custos Rotulorum of Dorset. The Arundells, led by Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, subsequently became known as some of the most active of the Catholic landowners in England at the time of the Reformation; thus they were naturally Royalists in the English Civil War. During that conflict, Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour, was away from home on the King's business and had asked his wife, Lady Blanche Arundell, aged 61, to defend the castle with a garrison of 25 trained fighting men. On 2 May 1643 Sir Edward Hungerford, with 1,300 men of the Parliamentarian Army, demanded admittance to search for Royalists. He was refused and laid siege, setting about the walls with guns and mines. After five days the castle was threatened with complete destruction. Lady Arundell agreed to surrender, and the castle was placed under the command of Colonel Edmund Ludlow. Lord Arundell had died of his wounds after the Battle of Stratton, and his son, Henry 3rd Lord Arundell, next laid siege to his own castle, blew up much of it and obliged the Parliamentary garrison to surrender in March 1644.\n Link Information:  Thomas Arundell of Wardour Castle in Wiltshire (c. 150226 February 1552) Question: How old was Sir Thomas Arundell when he purchased Wardour Castle?",

Passage:West's first major roles were on Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show, which were two of the first three Nicktoons on Nickelodeon (the other being Rugrats). Over his career, West has been the voice talent for close to 120 different characters including some of the most iconic animated figures in television history. He has become one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Mel Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, the voice Arthur Q. Bryan used for Elmer Fudd, as well as other characters from Warner Bros. cartoons. In 1998, Entertainment Weekly described West as \"the new Mel Blanc\" and noted his ability to mimic well-known voices, though he would rather develop original voices. West's favorite characters are Philip J. Fry and Stimpy, both of which he originated. West has been very outspoken over his displeasure about the influx of movie star actors providing voice-over for films and major shows. West has stated that he did not like the Disney version of Doug and that he \"couldn't watch\" the show. West was the voice of the show's namesake, Geeker, throughout Project Geekers 13-episode run. West was the voice of Zim in the original pilot for Invader Zim. Richard Steven Horvitz was chosen for the series role because West's voice was too recognizable, according to creator Jhonen Vasquez during DVD commentary. West is the voice of \"Red\" in numerous M&M commercials as well as the 3-D movie I Lost my M in Vegas, currently playing at M&M's World in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also voices a number of minor characters in the series . He voiced the character Moobeard in Moobeard the Cow Pirate, a short animation featured on Random! Cartoons and reprises his role as Elmer Fudd in Cartoon Network's series The Looney Tunes Show. In 1999, he also had a cameo in the Emmy Award-winning cartoon Dilbert.\n Links: a.

Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n\n Under the watchful eyes of Father Silvano Bentivoglio (Carmen Argenziano) and Dr. Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) initiates the Large Hadron Collider and creates three vials of antimatter particles larger than any ever been produced before. Almost immediately, Father Silvano is killed and one of the vials of antimatter goes missing. At the same time, the Roman Catholic Church is mourning the sudden death of Pope Pius XVI in Rome and prepares for the papal conclave to elect the next Pope. The Camerlengo, Father Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), assumes temporary control of the Vatican. Before the conclave enters seclusion, four of the \"preferiti\" (the favorite cardinals to be elected pope) are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the Illuminati. In a video message, he threatens to kill one candidate every hour starting at 8pm and to destroy all of Vatican City at midnight, using the missing vial of antimatter as a bomb. The Vatican summons symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) from Harvard University and Vetra to help them save the four preferiti and locate the vial.\nLangdon listens to the Illuminati's message and deduces the four cardinals will die at the four altars of the \"Path of Illumination\", marked by statues of angels in locations relevant to the four classical elements. Over the objections of Commander Maximilian Richter, head of the Swiss Guard, but with McKenna's consent, Langdon is granted access to the Vatican Secret Archives. He examines Galileo Galilei's banned book with Vetra. Following the clues and accompanied by Inspector General Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the Vatican Gendarmerie Corps, they arrive at the Chigi Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo. There they find Cardinal Ebner dead, suffocated with soil and branded with an ambigrammatic word \"Earth\". They verify the second location is the crowded Saint Peter's Square and arrive just as a bloody Cardinal Lamass  emerges with his chest branded with \"Air\". Vetra unsuccessfully attempts to perform CPR on him, only to discover his lungs had been punctured, while the assassin slips through the crowd.\nWhile Vetra studies Silvano's diaries, Langdon, Olivetti and Vincenzi locate the third church, Santa Maria della Vittoria, and arrive to see Cardinal Guidera, branded \"Fire\" and suspended above a burning pile of wood. A gunfight erupts between the assassin and the officers, with Olivetti and Vincenzi being killed in the process. Langdon manages to escape, but not before being spotted by the assassin. Langdon convinces two Carabinieri officers to take him to the next location and the trio race to the Water altar, the Fountain of the Four Rivers, just as the assassin arrives in a van. The assassin murders the officers and drops a bound and weighted Cardinal Baggia into the fountain before bidding farewell to Langdon and driving off. With the help of bystanders, Langdon rescues the cardinal, who tells him the Illuminati's lair is Castel Sant'Angelo. There, Langdon and Vetra discover a hidden passageway leading to the Vatican, being used as a hideout for the assassin. Discovering a case with marks for five branding irons, they realize the fifth brand is for the Camerlengo but are confronted by the assassin before they can alert McKenna. The assassin spares their lives once more, stating killing them is not a part of his mission unless they pursue him. He then cryptically warns them to be careful as his contractors are \"men of God\" before departing. He escapes to a car left for him by his contractor, but is killed immediately when it explodes upon ignition.\nLangdon and Vetra rush back to the Vatican where they find Commander Richter hovering over McKenna with a gun, the Vatican symbol branded into McKenna's chest. Richter and Archbishop Simeon are shot by the Guards. As Richter dies before Langdon, he opens his hand to reveal a key which Langdon takes. The stolen antimatter vial is found in St. Peter's Tomb below the church, but the battery life is too low to risk re-connecting it to a battery. McKenna, a former military pilot, seizes the vial and uses an awaiting helicopter to fly above the Vatican. At a high altitude, he parachutes out as the antimatter bomb explodes overhead. McKenna is hailed a hero and savior, and the cardinals move to elect him pope. Langdon and Vetra use Richter's key to watch a security video showing McKenna speaking to Richter before the attack. The video reveals it is McKenna, not the Illuminati, who masterminded the scheme. McKenna reveals he murdered the previous pope because he felt the pope had betrayed the church by trying to bridge the gap between science and religion. Once McKenna had killed the pope, he intended to have himself elected to the papacy whilst rallying the most conservative Cardinals to his side. The recording is shown to the Papal conclave, and when it dawns on McKenna he has been exposed. He flees to a remote recess in the building where he is able to commit suicide by setting himself on fire.\nThe Vatican officially announces McKenna died due to internal injuries suffered during his parachute landing, and Cardinal Baggia is named Pope Luke, with Cardinal Strauss as the new Camerlengo. Strauss thanks Langdon for his assistance and gives Langdon Galileo's \"Diagramma Veritatis\" for his research as a gift from himself and Pope Luke, requesting only it be returned to the Vatican once he is finished, and any future references he may make about the Catholic Church in his future publications be done gently, to which Langdon replies, \"I'll try.\"",

Wells then moved to Naughty Dog, where he worked on  (1998), Crash Team Racing (1999),  (2001), Jak II (2003), Jak 3 (2004) and  (2005). Following the departure of founders Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin in 2004, Wells became co-president of Naughty Dog alongside Stephen White; White was replaced by Christophe Balestra after a year. Wells continued to work as co-president during the release of the Uncharted titles (2007\u201317), as well as The Last of Us (2013). Balestra retired from the company in April 2017; Wells remains the sole president. Neil Druckmann was promoted to Vice President in March 2018.\n Passage 2:Olvir Hnufa or \u00d6lvir hn\u00fafa was a Norwegian commander in a clan and poet of the late ninth and early tenth centuries, known from, among other sources, Egil's Saga, Skaldatal and the Prose Edda. Olvir was the son of the viking Berle-Kari and brother-in-law of Kveldulf Bjalfason, who married Olvir's sister Salbjorg Karadottir; he was thus uncle to Skallagrim and Thorolf Kveldulfsson and great uncle to the famous poet Egil Skallagrimsson. Olvir also had a brother named Eyvind Lambi. Olvir was a prominent member of the court of King Harald Fairhair, who united Norway under his rule in the late ninth or early tenth century. Among other famous poets, he served as one of King Harald's court poets. He also served as a warrior in Harald's retinue, and fought at the pivotal Battle of Hafrsfjord on the king's flagship. He is best known for his involvement in the conflict between Harald and Olvir's kinsman Thorolf Kveldulfsson, which ended with the latter's death. Only a few fragments of Olvir's poetry survive.\n Passage 3:Specific attractions include the world's only complete collection of Vanwall cars, a near-complete collection of McLaren Formula One cars from the team's inception to the early 2000s, and extensive collections of Williams and BRM cars (including examples of both notorious BRM V16-powered machines as well as the H16-powered BRM P83). The collection also has examples of four different four-wheel drive Formula One cars, including an unraced Cosworth car. Another star exhibit is the Lotus 18 with which Stirling Moss won the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix, along with Jim Clark's World Championship-winning Lotus 25. Noticeable, however, is the distinct lack of Ferrari vehicles, 3 in all, but fine examples nonetheless. First being a Ferrari 312 driven by Chris Amon, second a 312B and thirdly, a Ferrari F2000 (The particular chassis driven to victory in the 2000 Canadian Grand Prix, one of nine victories for Michael Schumacher in his maiden championship winning series with Ferrari), conversely, the establishment houses the Jordan 191 in which he made his formula 1 debut in 1991.

And looking at other countries that have been hit hard by the virus, including China and Italy, it\u2019s not an idle question. On March 12, a reader sent us a comment from a website called Stop Mandatory Vaccination, run by a group that opposes bills to curb exemptions for vaccinations. (Here\u2019s some background on the anti-vaccine movement.) The website said in part, \"\"The CDC can detain anyone with a fever \u2014 indefinitely. \u2026 Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention.\"\" Similar comments on social media soon prompted high-level debunkings. Late on March 15, the National Security Council took to Twitter to knock down rumors about a national quarantine: \"\"Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus.\"\" Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus Quarantines are real, but there\u2019s a lot of misinformation floating around about the details. Here, we\u2019ll attempt to clarify what\u2019s accurate, and what\u2019s not, about quarantines. (An inquiry to Stop Mandatory Vaccination was not returned.) There are two related terms that address this phenomenon: quarantine and isolation. \"\"Isolation\"\" separates people with a confirmed case of a communicable disease from people who are not sick. \"\"Quarantine\"\" separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. The last federal quarantine prior to the coronavirus outbreak came in the early 1960s, when officials were concerned about a smallpox outbreak. It\u2019s been a century \u2014 back to the 1918-19 \"\"Spanish flu\"\" pandemic \u2014 since large-scale isolations and quarantines were last enforced. Federal quarantine power stems from Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries and between states. Federal regulations revised in 2017 allow the CDC \"\"to detain, medically examine, and release persons arriving into the United States and traveling between states who are suspected of carrying\"\" certain communicable diseases. (Here\u2019s what a sample quarantine order looks like.) Those powers are carried out with help from other federal agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard. This federal government has exercised this power recently with travelers returning from locations where coronavirus has been spreading, based on presidential proclamations like this one. So far we\u2019ve been referring to federal quarantines. But most quarantine power actually resides with state and local governments, as well as tribal law on tribal lands. That\u2019s because federal quarantine powers are limited to persons entering the United States from elsewhere. By contrast, states and localities enforce those powers within their own borders \"\"CDC officials are \u2018preparing as if (the new coronavirus) is the next pandemic,\u2019 but in reality, the laboring oar falls to state and local health departments,\"\" Polly J. Price, a professor of law and global health at Emory University, has written in the Atlantic. So the assertion we\u2019re checking in this article, by focusing on CDC, misses a lot of where the action is: state and local governments. Historically, forcible quarantines have been rare, and they require a court order. Most of the time, experts said, people who are infected are released on their own recognizance with a promise to self-quarantine. There\u2019s judicial precedent for quarantine powers dating back to the early 1800s, but subsequent case law has required a degree of due process, especially given that a quarantine, unlike an arrest, involves the detention of someone who is not suspected of a crime. Past cases \"\"suggest that there are important limits on the ability of the U.S. and state and local governments when it comes to some types of public health action,\"\" said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University. The government has to show real harm, as well as that people get due process and a chance to appeal. Becoming subject to forcible quarantines isn\u2019t just a question of having a particular germ; it also requires a strong likelihood that you will spread it to other people. \"\"Since most people can take precautions, this typically only happens in the case of person who can\u2019t stay away from other people,\"\" such as people who have a severe mental illness, said Wendy K. Mariner, a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health. What if you refuse a mandatory order? Practical consequences for such an action are tricky. While fines and incarceration are allowed, no public health expert today recommends jailing a person unwilling to quarantine, because they would be introducing a contagion into a confined population. \"\"The likelier answer is hospitals with secure wards,\"\" Mariner said. Not any fever gets you quarantined, contrary to the assertion we\u2019re checking. The government \"\"would have to have good evidence that the individual was exposed to COVID-19\"\" to impose a quarantine, said Lawrence O. Gostin, faculty director of Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. \"\"\u2018Fever\u2019 is too broad a definition,\"\" Mariner agreed. In addition to coronavirus, the CDC is able to quarantine only for the following diseases: cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS and pandemic flu. It\u2019s an exaggeration to say quarantine is \"\"indefinite\"\" detention by the government, especially given what we know so far about the course of coronavirus disease. First, as we noted, quarantine is usually self-regulated. And for those instances when it\u2019s not, such as when an individual is uncooperative, the person is able to leave quarantine when they are no longer contagious. Vaccination doesn\u2019t get you out of quarantine. Typically, vaccinations aren\u2019t cures; they\u2019re preventive measures. In any case, it\u2019s moot for coronavirus, because there is no vaccine yet. Claims on the internet said \"\"the CDC can detain anyone with a fever \u2014 indefinitely. \u2026 Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention.\"\" The CDC does have the power to isolate people with certain infectious diseases and quarantine those who had contact with an infected person. But this claim is wrong or misleading about many of the details. Most quarantine decisions will be up to states and localities, rather than the CDC. People can\u2019t be quarantined for just having a fever; they have to be shown to have been exposed to a specific set of diseases. Most quarantines are done voluntarily, not by force of the state. And vaccination is not a ticket out of quarantine.\" Claim: \u201cThe CDC can detain anyone with a fever \u2014 indefinitely. \u2026 Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention.\u201d",

A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy--a number that corresponds to roughly 5 percent of all married couples of reproductive age. In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\\n\\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\\n\\nHow is vasectomy done?\\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below \u2212300\u00b0F (\u2212185\u00b0F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period.

The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said preliminary data show that the ACOs produced $380 million in savings vis-a-vis traditional Medicare in 2012 by giving doctors and other healthcare providers the incentive to focus on improved outcomes for patients instead of fees from tests and services. Medicare, the $575 billion government healthcare system for 51 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, faces growing financial pressures as a result of America\u2019s aging population. A mainstay, the trust fund that pays for hospitalization, is expected to be exhausted in 2026. Deficit hawks view Medicare as a future driver of the federal debt and have called for major systemic reforms. But the Obama administration has pursued gradual changes including the reform of care delivery systems. So-called fee-for-service medicine is widely viewed as a cause of rising healthcare costs, because it calls for paying healthcare providers for tests and services that are sometimes unnecessary. Obamacare seeks to tackle costs by exploring ACOs and other new healthcare business models intended to find savings that do not jeopardize care. A main goal is to generate savings large enough to be shared between Medicare and providers. But some experts are skeptical, saying significant cost reductions could be hard to maintain over time. But CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, runs two different ACO programs. In its largest, 54 of 114 ACO networks achieved lower than expected expenditures. But only 29 saw savings big enough to share with providers. All told, the program produced $128 million in net savings for Medicare\u2019s trust funds. \u201cOverall, the ACO program\u2019s a net saver to the Medicare program,\u201d CMS principal deputy administrator Jon Blum told reporters in a conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s giving us great confidence that this is the right course for the Medicare program and we are confident that it will continue to show quality improvement and cost savings.\u201d  Officials said the ACOs also achieved a wide range of quality goals. But CMS released no quality statistics. Thursday\u2019s government release drew some cautious optimism from the healthcare industry. \u201cToday\u2019s report reflects important steps. More work is needed to modernize our antiquated Medicare payment system and base payment on evidence-based quality measures and proven patient outcomes,\u201d said Dr. John Noseworthy, chief executive of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which is not part of the government\u2019s program. \u201cAs results of the team-based care models are analyzed, those most effective in driving down health care costs without compromising safety and quality should become part of the healthcare system,\u201d he said.

Elizabeth Warren loves to tout her plans for any and all policy questions, including climate change, child care and especially health care. This became a point of contention during the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas on Feb. 19, where she\u00a0criticized her rivals over a lack of specificity in their health plans. Warren said a proposal from Pete Buttigieg is \"\"not a plan. It's a PowerPoint.\"\" Then she turned to Senate colleague Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. \"\"And Amy's plan is even less,\"\" Warren said. \"\"It's like a Post-It note, 'Insert Plan Here.'\"\" After some additional digs and discussion,\u00a0Warren and Klobuchar had this\u00a0exchange: Warren: \"\"So I actually took a look at the plans that are posted. \u2026 Amy, I looked online at your plan. It's two paragraphs. Families are suffering, and they need \u2026\"\" Klobuchar: \"\"OK, that's it.\"\" Warren: \"\"You can't simply stand here and trash an idea to give health care coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own. And if you're not going to own up to the fact either that you don't have a plan or that your plan is going to leave people without health care coverage, full coverage, then you need to say so.\"\" Warren\u2019s campaign told PolitiFact that she was referring specifically to Klobuchar\u2019s plan for \"\"universal health care.\"\" Her campaign pointed to the two paragraphs at the end of a Klobuchar campaign web page that specifically follow the heading \"\"Propose legislation to get us to universal health care.\"\" However, this is a selective reading of the health care policy pages that Klobuchar posted on her website. Klobuchar supports building on the Affordable Care Act and adding a public option that expands Medicare and Medicaid. By contrast, Warren initially joined rival candidate Bernie Sanders in supporting a wholesale switch to a single-player plan \u2014 a more aggressive approach than Klobuchar\u2019s \u2014 then later eased off. Warren currently backs two bills, one for a public option and another for a single-payer plan. The problem with Warren\u2019s attack is that it focuses on two paragraphs, which ignores most of her rival\u2019s health care plan. There is quite a bit of detail in Klobuchar\u2019s plan. Klobuchar\u2019s website has no fewer than four different web pages that address the topic \u2014 a main health care policy page, a more detailed sub-page, a sub-page on prescription drugs and a sub-page on mental health. Some of Klobuchar\u2019s bullet-pointed priorities include: \u2022 \"\"Immediately suspend the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\"\" \u2022 \"\"Develop best models of care to address disparities in maternal and infant mortality and address the shortage of maternity care health professionals in underserved rural and urban areas.\"\" \u2022 \"\"Expand Medicaid reimbursement for people receiving mental health or substance use treatment.\"\" \u2022 \"\"Expand the open enrollment period for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act so more people can get insurance coverage.\"\" \u2022 \"\"Stop Trump sabotage of the ACA by ending workarounds that allow states to raise premiums for sicker people and shift ACA premium subsidies away from lower-income enrollees.\"\" All told, the four Klobuchar web pages by our count have 64 paragraphs, not counting overlap \u2014 far more than two. Warren said, \"\"Amy, I looked online at your (health care) plan. It\u2019s two paragraphs.\"\" Warren\u2019s campaign said she was referring to just the paragraphs that specifically addressed universal health care. That wasn't clear on stage, where she dismissed Klobuchar's health policy ideas as small enough to fit on a Post-It. Klobuchar's two paragraphs on universal health care are just one part of a four-webpage policy statement that collectively runs 64 paragraphs long.\" Claim: Amy, I looked online at your (health care) plan.

A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\nDid M0 's sibling , child , and spouse marry M1",

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

As an argument for the latter hypothesis the occurrence of dermal, nerve-associated Merkel cells in human fetal skin has often been mentioned. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of Merkel cells in epidermis and dermis of plantar skin of human embryos and fetuses, ranging in gestational age between 7 and 17 weeks. Merkel cells were identified by immunocytochemistry on frozen sections using antibodies against simple epithelium-type cytokeratins and by electron microscopy. In the 17-week-old fetus, 17% of the total cutaneous (epidermal and dermal) Merkel cells were located in the upper dermal compartment, whereas in the 14-week-old fetus only 3.9% of the Merkel cells were dermal, including some cells that seemed to be in the process of traversing the dermal-epidermal junction. Thirteen-week-old fetuses showed even fewer dermal Merkel cells. Twelve-week-old fetuses exhibited 660 epidermal Merkel cells per 100 mm total section length, but none in the upper or deep dermis. In 7- to 9-week embryos, no Merkel cells were recognized. However, at this stage, but not in later stages, the basal cells of the plantar epidermis expressed certain simple epithelium-type cytokeratin polypeptides. These results speak against an invasion of Merkel cells or putative neural crest-derived precursor cells into the epidermis via a dermal passage. They suggest that in plantar skin Merkel cells arise, between weeks 8-12, from precursor stages of epithelial cells of the early fetal epidermis which still express simple epithelium-type cytokeratins. The results further suggest that in subsequent stages of skin development some epidermal Merkel cells detach from the epithelium and migrate into the upper dermis where some of them may associate with small nerves. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Animal 2)Antibodies, Monoclonal 3)Mice",

The main purpose of the present study is to investigate GALT induced cross-protection between different APP serotypes and elucidate key mechanisms of the immune response to GALT antigenic stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that galT is a highly conserved gene in APP, widely distributed across multiple pathogenic strains. Homologies between any two strains ranges from 78.9% to 100% regarding the galT locus. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that GALT specific antibodies could not be induced by inactivated APP L20 or MS71 whole cell bacterin preparations. A recombinant fusion GALT protein derived from APP L20, however has proven to be an effective cross-protective antigen against APP sevorar 1 MS71 (50%, 4/8) and APP sevorar 5b L20 (75%, 6/8). Histopathological examinations have confirmed that recombinant GALT vaccinated animals showed less severe pathological signs in lung tissues than negative controls after APP challenge. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that the infiltration of neutrophils in the negative group is significantly increased compared with that in the normal control (P<0.001) and that in surviving animals is decreased compared to the negative group. Anti-GALT antibodies were shown to mediate phagocytosis of neutrophils. After interaction with anti-GALT antibodies, survival rate of APP challenged vaccinated animals was significantly reduced (P<0.001). This study demonstrated that GALT is an effective cross-protective antigen, which could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against multiple APP serotypes. Wen X, et al.

There were 384 healthy mother and healthy-sized infant pairs in the Cleveland subsample and 75 such pairs in the Minneapolis sample. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the influence of prenatal weight gain and birth weight varied depending on prepregnancy weight status. Prenatal weight gains related to the birth of healthy-sized infants (newborns with birth weights of 3,000 to 4,500 gm) to healthy mothers in the Cleveland MIC sample averaged 33 lb for underweight, 32 lb for normal weight, 29 lb for overweight, and 19 lb for obese women.

We aimed to better define the situations where viral tests should be performed on BAL fluid (BALF). We retrospectively studied all cases where viral tests [immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, viral culture, and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] were performed on BALF during a period of 1 year (2008) in our institution. We compared the characteristics of patients with virus-positive versus virusnegative BALF. Of the 636 BALF samples sent to the microbiology laboratory, 232 underwent viral tests. Of these, 70 (30 %) were positive and identified 85 viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 (n027), cytomegalovirus (CMV, n023), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, n018), human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 (n012), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, n03), rhinovirus (n01), and adenovirus (n01). The variables associated with positive viral tests on univariate analysis were immunosuppression [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), corticosteroids >10 mg/day for \u22653 weeks, or other immunosuppressive therapy], ground-glass attenuations on computed tomography (CT) scanning, late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and durations of (i) hospital stay, (ii) intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and (iii) mechanical ventilation before BAL (p<0.01 for each comparison). On multivariate analysis, only immunosuppression [odds ratio (OR) 6.4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [2.8-14.3], p<0.0001] and groundglass attenuations (OR 3.7,], p00.0004) remained associated with virus-positive BAL. None of the viral tests performed on BALF for the initial assessment of diffuse infiltrative lung disease (n015) was positive. PCR improved the diagnostic yield of viral tests on BALF by 50 %.

The yeast histone deacetylase Sir2 silences transcription and stabilizes repetitive DNA, but during aging or in response to a DNA break, the Sir complex relocalizes to sites of genomic instability, resulting in the desilencing of genes that cause sterility, a characteristic of yeast aging. Using embryonic stem cells, we show that mammalian Sir2, SIRT1, represses repetitive DNA and a functionally diverse set of genes across the mouse genome. In response to DNA damage, SIRT1 dissociates from these loci and relocalizes to DNA breaks to promote repair, resulting in transcriptional changes that parallel those in the aging mouse brain. Increased SIRT1 expression promotes survival in a mouse model of genomic instability and suppresses age-dependent transcriptional changes. Thus, DNA damage-induced redistribution of SIRT1 and other chromatin-modifying proteins may be a conserved mechanism of aging in eukaryotes..

Infiltration of activated lymphocytes and myeloid cells are thought to be primarily responsible for white matter damage and axonopathy. Over time, this neurologic damage manifests clinically as debilitating motor and cognitive symptoms. Existing MS therapies focus on symptom relief and delay of disease progression through reduction of neuroinflammation. However, long-term strategies to remyelinate, protect, or regenerate axons have remained elusive, posing a challenge to treating progressive forms of MS. Preclinical mouse models and techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and genomic and proteomic analysis have provided advances in our understanding of discrete time-points of pathology following disease induction. More recently, in vivo and in situ two-photon (2P) microscopy has made it possible to visualize continuous real-time cellular behavior and structural changes occurring within the CNS during neuropathology. Research utilizing 2P imaging to study axonopathy in neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease has focused on five areas: (1) axonal morphologic changes, (2) organelle transport and health, (3) relationship to inflammation, (4) neuronal excitotoxicity, and (5) regenerative therapies. 2P imaging may also be used to identify novel therapeutic targets via identification and clarification of dynamic cellular and molecular mechanisms of axonal regeneration and remyelination. Here, we review tools that have made 2P accessible for imaging neuropathologies and advances in our understanding of axonal degeneration and repair in preclinical models of demyelinating diseases.

As DNA replication and transcription share the same template, conflicts between both processes are unavoidable and head-on collisions are thought to be particularly problematic. Surprisingly, a recent study reported unperturbed cell cycle progression in Escherichia coli cells with an ectopic replication origin in which highly transcribed rrn operons were forced to be replicated opposite to normal. In this study we have re-generated a similar strain and found the doubling time to be twice that of normal cells. Replication profiles of this background revealed significant deviations in comparison to wild-type profiles, particularly in highly transcribed regions and the termination area. These deviations were alleviated by mutations that either inactivate the termination area or destabilise RNA polymerase complexes and allow their easier displacement by replication forks. Our data demonstrate that head-on replication-transcription conflicts are highly problematic. Indeed, analysis of the replication profile of the previously published E. coli construct revealed a chromosomal rearrangement that alleviates replication-transcription conflicts in an intriguingly simple way. Our data support the idea that avoiding head-on collisions has significantly contributed to shaping the distinct architecture of bacterial chromosomes..

It can be inferred from context between these two lines that Schaefer was looking for someone who would fit well in this role, so he asked his friends (producers) for suggestions. Thus, the correct response to this input dialog is 'Schaefer sought out actors himself but also accepted actor recommendations from producers.'"
