It also allows analysts to understand the author\u2019s intended message and to understand the author\u2019s psychology. The theory suggests that human beings possess a nature within them that demonstrates their true \u201cself\u201d and it suggests that the fulfillment of this nature is the reason for living. It also suggests that neurological development hinders actualizing the nature because a person becomes estranged from his or her true self.

The pro-Western Shah of Iran led the country until 1979, when he was overthrown among great resentment among the people for his continuing efforts to westernize the country and for his repressive policies. Ayatollah Khomeini assumed control of the country. The Shah was exiled to Egypt and later went to the U.S. to receive cancer treatments. Although President Carter allowed the Shah to come to the U.S. for humanitarian reasons, the people of Iran viewed it as more fuel for the anti-American fire.On November 4, 1979, militants are protesting outside the U.S. embassy in Tehran. They are demanding the Shah be returned to Iran to stand trial. When some of the protesters manage to scale the boundary fence, orders are given to start destroying all embassy records, some by shredding and some by burning. Equipment is also destroyed.The head of embassy security attempts to go outside and reason with the militants, but he's immediately captured and taken hostage. The marines charged with guarding the embassy are armed, but their leader cautions them not to shoot anyone. They limit their efforts to the use of tear gas, but once the chains on the outside gates are removed, the militants storm the embassy and take 66 of the 72 diplomats and embassy staff hostage. Six of the staff, in the only building with a direct exit to the street, are able to escape and hide in the home of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). (Fourteen of the hostages were later released, mostly because they were from countries already considered repressed by the U.S., or for health reasons.)One of the militants comes across a poster photo of the Ayatollah with several darts in it, adding to the furor of the moment.In the following days, weeks and months, the hostages were blindfolded and paraded in front of TV cameras and jeering...\n",

It all begins in the late 1920s when Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home and embarks on her own with her four sons on a robbery-murder spree to make her own fortune, while keeping them under a tight leash.When Herman and Fred are arrested and imprisoned for petty theft charges, Ma takes over the group and leads Arthur and Lloyd on a bank robbery spree to gain enough money to get her sons out of jail. The gang is joined by a gunman named Kevin (Bruce Dern) (patterned after gunman Alvin Karpis) whom was Fred's cellmate during his incarceration and his (strongly implied) lover. The group is also joined by a local prositute named Mona Gibson (Diane Varsi), whom Herman frequented before his imprisonment. The gang resorts to more violent action and robberies.While hiding out at a cabin in Kentucky, Lloyd comes across a young woman swimming at a nearby lake whom he sexually assaults. Not wanting the woman to report them to the police, the Barkers hold her captive and Ma eventually kills her by drowning her despite the protests of her sons.Another time later, the gang arrives in Tennessee where they abduct a wealthy businessman named Sam Pendlebury (Pat Hingle) (patterned after brewerymaker William Hamm whom the Barker gang kidnapped in 1933).

His job was to remove anything that might be used as a weapon, and he duly had \"about a quarter of a load\" of stones carted away.Monday, 16 August 1819, was a hot summer's day, with a cloudless blue sky. The fine weather almost certainly increased the size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.The Manchester magistrates met at 9:00 am, to breakfast at the Star Inn on Deansgate and to consider what action they should take on Henry Hunt's arrival at the meeting. By 10:30 am they had come to no conclusions, and moved to a house on the southeastern corner of St Peter's Field, from where they planned to observe the meeting.\nThey were concerned that it would end in a riot, or even a rebellion, and had arranged for a substantial number of regular troops and militia yeomanry to be deployed. The military presence comprised 600 men of the 15th Hussars; several hundred infantrymen; a Royal Horse Artillery unit with two six-pounder  guns; 400 men of the Cheshire Yeomanry; 400 special constables; and 120 cavalry of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry. The Manchester & Salford Yeomanry were relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen, the most numerous of which were publicans.

Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to \"make it easier on\" herself, but she heard \"that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted.\" In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was \"a natural\" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, \"they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by IGN who liked that she did not portray her character \"as a victimized female\" but instead \"as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate.\"\nIn addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the film's soundtrack, where she contributed four songs. \"Try Again\" was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on airplay; this led the song to be released in a 12\" vinyl and 7\" single.

He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings.\nEl Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting., can you guess it ?\n\n",

The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence first of Richard Hoggart, E. P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams, and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham. This included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular culture as \"capitalist\" mass culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of the Frankfurt School critique of the \"culture industry\" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy.",

The administration was highly decentralised and feudatory clans such as the Alupas, the Hoysalas, the Kakatiya, the Seuna, the southern Kalachuri and others were allowed to rule their autonomous provinces, paying an annual tribute to the Chalukya emperor. Excavated inscriptions record titles such as Mahapradhana (Chief minister), Sandhivigrahika, and Dharmadhikari (chief justice). Some positions such as Tadeyadandanayaka (commander of reserve army) were specialised in function while all ministerial positions included the role of Dandanayaka (commander), showing that cabinet members were trained as army commanders as well as in general administrative skills.The kingdom was divided into provinces such as Banavasi-12000, Nolambavadi-32000, Gangavadi-96000, each name including the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in Belavola-300. The big provinces were called Mandala and under them were Nadu further divided into Kampanas (groups of villages) and finally a Bada (village). A Mandala was under a member of the royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. Tailapa II himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the Rashtrakuta rule. Chiefs of Mandalas were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Someshvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered Nadus and Kampanas. Army commanders were titled Mahamandaleshwaras and those who headed a Nadu were entitled Nadugouvnda.The Western Chalukyas minted punch-marked gold pagodas with Kannada and Nagari legends which were large, thin gold coins with several varying punch marks on the obverse side.

Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity.\n\nBut I can use this background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]\n\nAn important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.\n\nWhat is an answer for this question: Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt?",

He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the Alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (De revolutionibus) and Reinhold (Prutenic tables). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 14,33,9,57 (Alphonsine), 14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold).

Data is obtained from \"PreCogs,\" three mutated humans who can see into the future.

A red ball indicates a crime of passion, which, due to the lack of premeditation, cannot be seen until often no less than an hour before the crime is to be committed.The only three things that the PreCogs can predict are the victim or victims, the perpetrator, and the exact date and time of the crime.

Once they are certain of the location, the team flies there to thwart the crime. They then secure the culprit by \"haloing\" him (a device placed around his head that renders him fully incapacitated).After the suspect has been apprehended, the murder reappears on the displays.

In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.\n\nParagraph: Keith is a doctor in a local hospital. Today, he is seeing three patients, patient A, patient B, and patient C.

He was U.S. Chess Champion in 1944 and 1946.\n\n- The headquarters of the United Nations is a complex in New York City designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. The complex has served as the official headquarters of the United Nations since its completion in 1952. It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, on spacious grounds overlooking the East River. Its borders are First Avenue on the west, East 42nd Street to the south, East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east. The term \"Turtle Bay\" is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole.\n\n- Pal Benko (born July 14, 1928) is a chess grandmaster, author, and composer of endgame studies and chess problems.\n\n- Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the UK, the term head office is most commonly used for the HQs of large corporations. The term is also used regarding military organizations.\n\n- A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.\n\n- Robert James \"Bobby\" Fischer (March 9, 1943\u00a0 January 17, 2008) was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. Many consider him to be the greatest chess player of all time. In 1972, he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match held in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, publicized as a Cold War confrontation, which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since. In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE, the game's international governing body, over one of the conditions for the match. This allowed Soviet GM Anatoly Karpov, who had won the qualifying Candidates' cycle, to become the new world champion by default under FIDE rules.\n\n- Herbert Seidman ( 17 October 1920 -- 30 August 1995 ) was a U.S. Senior Master of chess born in New York City . He played several times in the U.S. Chess Championship . He was known for his swashbuckling - style . He defeated many notable players , including Pal Benko , Arthur Bisguier , Donald Byrne , Arnold Denker , William Lombardy , Edmar Mednis , Samuel Reshevsky , and Jan Timman . In 1961 , Seidman won the most games of any player in the U.S. Championship , but did not win the tournament . He played on board eight in the famous USA vs USSR radio match in September 1945 , losing both games to Viacheslav Ragozin .\n\n- A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \"board\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill.\n\n- A chess problem, also called a chess composition, is a puzzle set by somebody using chess pieces on a chess board, that presents the solver with a particular task to be achieved. For instance, a position might be given with the instruction that White is to move first, and checkmate Black in two moves against any possible defense. A person who creates such problems is known as a composer. There is a good deal of specialized jargon used in connection with chess problems; see glossary of chess problems for a list.\n\n- The U.S. Chess Championship is an invitational tournament held to determine the national chess champion of the United States. Begun as a challenge match in 1845, the U.S. Championship has been decided by tournament play for most of its long history (Soltis, 2012). Since 1936, it has been held under the auspices of the U.S. Chess Federation. Until 1999, the event consisted of a round-robin tournament of varying size. From 1999 to 2006, the Championship was sponsored and organized by the Seattle Chess Foundation (later renamed America's Foundation for Chess [AF4C]) as a large Swiss system tournament. AF4C withdrew its sponsorship in 2007. The 2007 and 2008 events were held (again under the Swiss system) in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis in St Louis has hosted the annual event since 2009.\n\n- William James Lombardy (born December 4, 1937) is an American chess grandmaster, chess writer, teacher, and a former Catholic priest. He was one of the leading American chess players during the 1950s and 1960s, and a contemporary of Bobby Fischer, whom he coached from the time Fischer was aged 11 through the World Chess Championship 1972. Lombardy led the U.S. Student Team to Gold in the 1960 World Student Team Championship in Leningrad. He was the only World Junior Champion to win with a perfect score.\n\n- A chessboard is the type of checkerboard used in the classic board game chess, and consists of 64 squares (eight rows and eight columns) and 32 pieces. The squares are arranged in two alternating colors (light and dark). Wooden boards may use naturally light and dark brown woods, while plastic and vinyl boards often use brown or green for the dark squares and shades such as buff or cream for the light squares. Materials vary widely; while wooden boards are generally used in high-level games; vinyl, plastic, and cardboard are common for low-level and informal play. Decorative glass and marble boards are available but rarely accepted for games rated by national or international chess federations. Each square on the board has a name from a1 to h8.\n\n- Samuel \"Sammy\" Herman Reshevsky (born Szmul Rzeszewski; November 26, 1911  April 4, 1992) was a Polish chess prodigy and later a leading American chess grandmaster. He was never a full-time chess professional. He was a strong contender for the World Chess Championship from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s: he came equal third in the 1948 World Chess Championship tournament, and equal second in the 1953 Candidates Tournament. He was an eight-time winner of the U.S. Chess Championship. An outstanding match player throughout his career, Reshevsky excelled at positional play, and could be a brilliant tactician when required. He took a long time over his opening moves, and often found himself under time pressure, but this sometimes unsettled his opponent more than it did Reshevsky.\n\n- Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov (born May 23, 1951) is a Russian chess grandmaster and former World Champion. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov. He played three matches against Kasparov for the title from 1986 to 1990, before becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules. For his decades-long standing among the world's elite, Karpov is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time.\n\n- Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64\u00a0squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. Chess is played by millions of people worldwide, both amateurs and professionals.\n\n- The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \"New York minute\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.\n\n- Arthur Bernard Bisguier (born October 8, 1929) is an American chess Grandmaster, chess promoter, and writer. \n\n- Research comprises \"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc.\n\n- The World Chess Championship 1972 was a match for the World Chess Championship between challenger Bobby Fischer of the United States and defending champion Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. The match took place in the Laugardalsh\u00f6ll arena in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, and has been dubbed the Match of the Century. Fischer became the first American born in the United States to win the world title, and the second American overall (Wilhelm Steinitz, the first world champion, became a naturalized American citizen in 1888). Fischer's win also ended, for a short time, 24 years of Soviet domination of the World Championship.\n\n- Jan Timman (born 14 December 1951) is a Dutch chess Grandmaster who was one of the world's leading players from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. At the peak of his career he was considered to be the best non-Soviet player and was known as \"The Best of the West\". He has won the Dutch Chess Championship nine times and has been a Candidate for the World Championship several times. He lost the title match of the 1993 FIDE World Championship against Anatoly Karpov. \n\n- Edmar John Mednis (Edmrs Mednis) (March 22, 1937 February 13, 2002) was an American International Grandmaster of chess (awarded in 1980) born in Riga, Latvia.

On 3 February 1966 the Luna 9 spacecraft became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, or any planetary body other than Earth, and to transmit photographic data to Earth from the surface of another planetary body.\n\n- The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. \n\n- In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\n\n- Luna E- 6 No.2 , also identified as No.1 , and sometimes known in the West as Sputnik 25 , was a Soviet spacecraft which launched in 1963 , but was placed into a useless orbit due to a problem with the upper stage of the rocket that launched it . It was a 1,500 - kilogram ( 3,300 lb ) Luna E- 6 spacecraft , the first of twelve to be launched , It was intended to be the first spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the Moon , a goal which would eventually be accomplished by the final E- 6 spacecraft , Luna 9 . Luna E- 6 No.2 was launched at 08:49 UTC on 4 January 1963 , atop a Molniya - L 8K78L carrier rocket , flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome . The lower stages of the rocket performed nominally , delivering the upper stage and payload into low Earth orbit , however a transformer in the upper stage malfunctioned , which resulted in its ullage motors failing to ignite when the stage began its start - up sequence , sixty six minutes after launch . It remained in low Earth orbit until it decayed on 11 January 1963 . It was the first spacecraft to be launched in 1963 , and consequently the first to be assigned an International Designator , under the new system which had been introduced at the start of the year . The spacecraft consisted of a cylindrical section containing rockets and fuel for manoeuvring , attitude control and landing , as well as radio transmitters , and a 100 - kilogram ( 220 lb ) instrumented probe , which would have been ejected onto the surface after the spacecraft landed , carrying a camera and devices to measure radiation . It was intended to return data on the mechanical characteristics of the lunar surface , the hazards presented by the topology such as craters , rocks , and other obstructions , and radiation , in preparation for future manned landings . The designations Sputnik 33 , and later Sputnik 25 were used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents , since the Soviet Union did not release the...\n\n- The Luna programme (from the Russian word  \"Luna\" meaning \"Moon\"), occasionally called \"Lunik\" or \"Lunnik\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation.\n\n- A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that\nThe term \"planet\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \"planets\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.\n\n- Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\n\n- Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.\n\n- The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'luna e-6 no.2' with the relationship of 'series'.\n\nChoices:\n- 2\n - community\n - earth\n - life\n - luna programme\n - orbit\n - universe\n\n",

After the Qur'an and the prophets and imams, \"marji\" are the highest authority on religious laws in Usuli Shia Islam.\n\n- Ahmad Jannati is a hardline Iranian politician, Shi'i cleric and a founding member of Haghani school. He is the conservative chairman of the Assembly of Experts, the body charged with choosing the Supreme Leader; and also chairman of the Guardian Council, the body in charge of checking legislation approved by Majlis with the Constitution and \"sharia\", and approving the candidates in various elections. He is also a temporary Friday prayer imam of Tehran. His son Hossein Jannati was a member of People's Mujahedin of Iran and was killed in a street battle by the Islamic Republic security forces in 1981. He is also father of Ali Jannati, who served as Minister of Culture.\n\n- Ayatollah (or ; from \"Sign of Allah\") is a high-ranking title given to Usuli Twelver Shah clerics. Those who carry the title are experts in Islamic studies such as jurisprudence, quran reading, and philosophy and usually teach in Islamic seminaries. The next lower clerical rank is Hujjat al-Islam.\n\n- The Assembly of Experts (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of Iran consisting of eighty eight (88) Mujtahids (Islamic theologians) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities.\nMembers of the assembly are elected from lists of candidates by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet for at least two days every six months. The current chairman of the Fifth Assembly is Ahmad Jannati. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts.\n\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\n\n- The Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom (    ) was founded 1961 by the leading Muslim clerics of Qom. It was founded by the students of Ayatollah Khomeini after his exile to Iraq in order to organize political activities of Khomeini's followers and promote his revolutionary interpretation of Islam such as the idea of Islamic government. \nSince the 1979 revolution, it has become the body to keep the regime's registrar of who counts as a grand ayatollah, an ayatollah and a hojjatoleslam. Its head is appointed by the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic. It currently heads the Supreme Council of Qom Hawzas, and proposes judges to the judiciary system. \nThe body gained international prominence when it announced in 1981 that Ayatollah Shariatmadati was no longer a source of emulation (marja'). It has demoted a number of clerics over the last three decades. A recent case was that of Ayatollah Yousef Saanei who for his solidarity with the green movement was demoted from marja' to hojatoleslam. The Society also does not include Ayatollah Sistani on its list.\n\n- Isfahan (: pronounced ), historically also rendered in English as Ispahan, Sepahan, Esfahan or Hispahan, is the capital of Isfahan Province in Iran, located about south of Tehran. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 1,756,126 and its built-up (\"or metro\") area was home to 2,391,738 inhabitants including Khomeynishahr, Shahinshahr, Khvorasgan, Dorcheh Piaz, Falavarjan, Kelishad Va Sudarjan, Abrisham, Kushk and Kharizsang cities. The Greater Isfahan Region had a population of 3,793,104 in the 2011 Census, the second most populous metropolitan area in Iran after Tehran. The counties of Isfahan, Borkhar, Najafabad, Khomeynishahr, Shahinshahr, Mobarakeh, Falavarjan, Tiran o Karvan, Lenjan and Jay all constitute the metropolitan city of Isfahan.\n\n- Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \"de facto\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.\n\n- Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.\n\n- Grand Ayatollah Ahmad Azari-Qomi-Bigdeli (19251999) was an Iranian cleric.\n\n\n\nAfter reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'morteza moghtadai' with the relationship of 'position held'.\n\nChoices:\n- 12\n - 3\n - assembly of experts\n - ayatollah\n - bulgaria\n - deputy\n - grand ayatollah\n - leader\n - messiah\n - minister of culture\n - politician\n - president\n - sovereign\n\n",

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector\u2019s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of \u201cneoliberal\u201d ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy \u2013 the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act \u2013 which states:\n\u201cCompetition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.\u201d\nYet what might \u201craising our game\u201d mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an \u201canxiety machine\u201d: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now \u201cconsumers\u201d), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit \u2013 such as the REF and TEF \u2013 to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts \u2013 a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration.

        "source": "Information:\n\n- A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \"knighthood\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.\n\n- Henri or Hendrik Conscience (3 December 1812  10 September 1883) was a Belgian author. He is considered the pioneer of Dutch-language literature in Flanders, writing at a time when Belgium was dominated by the French language among the upper classes, in literature and government. Conscience fought as a Belgian revolutionary in 1830 and was a notable writer in the Romanticist style popular in the early 19th century. He is best known for his romantic nationalist novel, \"De Leeuw van Vlaenderen\" (1838), inspired by the victory of a Flemish peasant militia over French knights at the 1302 Battle of the Golden Spurs during the Franco-Flemish War.\n\n- The Battle of the Golden Spurs, also known as the Battle of Courtrai, was a battle fought between the Kingdom of France and the County of Flanders at Kortrijk (Courtrai in French) in modern-day Belgium on 11 July 1302.\n\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11\u00a0million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.\n\n- The High Middle Ages or High Medieval Period was the period of European history around the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 10011300). The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.\n\n- Pieter de Coninck ( died 1332 or 1333 ) was a weaver from Bruges well known for his role in the events surrounding the Battle of the Golden Spurs . He was not the head of the weavers ' guild as is popularly believed ( mostly because he was portrayed as such in the novel The Lion of Flanders by Hendrik Conscience ) . Together with Jan Breydel , a butcher , he was in the forefront of the popular uprising that led to the Battle of the Golden Spurs . Right before that battle he was knighted together with two of his sons . Before the Battle of the Golden Spurs began he was seen by the city government of Bruges as a dangerous agitator and was imprisoned in June 1301 . He was freed by the people of Bruges . Afterwards , the Leliaarts , a political faction supporting French rule , took over control of the city . Jacques de Ch\u00e2tillon , the then appointed governor of County of Flanders , entered Bruges with a small force and de Coninck was banished . Urged on by John I , Marquis of Namur , de Coninck restored his authority in Bruges in December 1301 . He tried to align the people of Ghent on the same side but failed . On 1 May 1302 he was one of the leaders of a gang of rebels who took the castle of Sijsele and Male . At Male , the rebels killed the entire French garrison . De Ch\u00e2tillon responded by again marching on Bruges with a force of 800 men , and again expelling de Coninck from the city . De Ch\u00e2tillon marched into the city with his army fully clad and battle - ready ( against established agreements with the city magistrates ) The people of Bruges , fearing bloody preprisals , and in order to protect themselves helped de Coninck to enter the city with his followers during the night . On 18 May 1302 , during the so - called Bruges Matins or `` Brugse Metten '' , nearly all the French present in Bruges and their Leliaart supporters were killed . De Ch\u00e2tillon barely managed to escape . After the Bruges Matins , de Coninck was one of the leaders of the Bruges militia that cleared the coastal area from Leliaart...\n\n\n\nGiven the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'date of birth'.\n\n",

She wrote a book \u2013 Come As You Are. Here\u2019s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can\u2019t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress \u2014 a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women\u2019s sex lives.\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don\u2019t often press them at the same time \u2013 in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver\u2019s ed \u2013 but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\nThat\u2019s right, you STOP!\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).\nQuestion: After writing this book, Dr. Nagoski became:\nOptions:\n\nA. famous\n\nB. homeless\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. depressed\n\n",

This suggests that others in her field find her work valuable since she discovered something new about human relationships (both male-female and female-male) with regards to how stress influences one's ability or desire to have sex and highlights the importance of this concept by saying \"it is a big deal.\"\nThese statements imply that after writing the book, Dr. Nagoski became famous among other researchers in her field because they were impressed by what she had done;"

I\u2019m in no way suggesting I\u2019m going to make a fortune, nor that I\u2019m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices.\nArt blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I\u2019m not even sure where the idea came from.

The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as \u2018art\u2019.\nOver the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it\u2019s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I  couldn\u2019t imagine how I ever functioned without it.\nWhat did the author study in college?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- not enough information\n- Art\n- Psychology\n- Film Editing\n",

Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840.

Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive.\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration.\nThe school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What does the school board want?\nOptions:\n\nA. this to be over\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. the student to decide he is really a girl\n\nD. the student to move out of state\n\n",

        "source": "Answer the following question given this paragraph: \n\n16.2 Prokaryotic Gene Regulation The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. Repressive control, typified by the trp operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter better. In the last example\u2014the lac operon\u2014two conditions must be met to initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the lac operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.\n\n\nQ: What are the three ways to control the transcription of an operon?\n\n\nA:",

In this case, two conditions must be met: firstly, glucose must not be present; secondly, lactose must be available. Based on these considerations it can therefore inferred that the answer would involve both repressor proteins (to prevent binding) and CAP-dependent activation (for RNA polymerase binding).\nTherefore , based on the above rationale , we choose option D as our final answer ."

They\u2019re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that.

We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts.\nWe did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko \u2013 a digital coaching tool for writers.

Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week.\nWhat seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing \u2013 and so made the process easier and less stressful.\n\u201cWhen I need to write I block out time. I\u2019m lucky in that I can work from home \u2013 I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet.\nOne of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, \u201cYou think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!\u201d as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse.\nI worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved.\nI was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been.\nIt is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato\u2019s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan\u2019s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \u201cIsland of Timber. \u201d The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go\u00advern\u00adors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.",

Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in\u00adto Anatolia, where it was qui\u00adck\u00adly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad\u00ad\u00advanced state of civilization.

Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \"This award came as a real surprise to me.

Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting\u2002\u2014\u2002later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century. \nBased on the previous passage, Who established relations with the Sui dynasty? \nIs \"Korea\" a correct answer?",

Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \"done what I had to.\" He told the club's official Web site: \"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season.

Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, the green turtle was listed as threatened except for the breeding populations in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, where it is listed as endangered.\nGreen turtles continue to be caught for money by humans, and the destruction and loss of nesting and foraging sites is a serious problem. Humans have already caused the decrease of large green turtle populations, including those that once nested in Bermuda and Cayman Islands. The situation of green turtle populations is difficult to determine because of our lack of knowledge about their life cycles. The number of nests in Florida appears to be increasing, but we don't know whether this is due to an increase in the number of nests or because we have started to monitor nesting beaches more closely.\nThe green turtle is the largest hardshelled sea turtle. Adults of this species commonly reach 100 cm in length and 150 kg in mass. The average size of a female nesting in Florida is 101.5 cm straight in length, with an average body mass of 136 kg.\nGrowth rates of green turtles have not been measured under natural conditions. Green turtles grow slowly.\nIn the southern Bahamas, green turtles grow from 30 to 75 cm in 17 years, and according to Bjorndal and Bolten, growth rates decrease with increasing length. Growth rates measured in green turtles from Florida and Puerto Rico fall within the range of growth rates measured in the southern Bahamas.

Would you please sell me some of your wine?\" Sam was a businessman  , so he said, \"You give me money, so of course I will sell some to you.\" Then he passed John a cup of wine.\nAfter drinking the wine, John felt warm soon, but Sam was still cold. Then he took out the ten cents that John just gave to him and said to John, \"Here is ten cents. Please sell me some of your wine.\" John agreed. Sam drank some wine and also felt much warmer. But after some time, they both felt cold again, so they kept buying wine from each other with the same ten cents.

He attended Central High School inCleveland. Langston was named Class Poet one year. He published his first short stories while still in high school.\nLangston Hughes struggled with a feeling of loneliness caused by his parents' divorce. He developed a love for reading books as a way to deal with the lack of time his parents spent with him. His love for reading grew into a desire to write. He wanted to reproduce the powerful effect other writers, like Walt Whitman, had made upon him.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1920, Langston moved to Mexico Cityto live with his father for one year. His father did not offer much warmth to him. Yet, Langston turned the pain caused by his family problems into one of his most famous poems,\" The Negro Speaks of Rivers.\" In this poem, he speaks of the strength and pride of black people in ancient African civilizations and inAmerica.\nLangston arrived in New Yorkat 19. Later, he left school, broke with his father, and began traveling. Traveling was a lifelong love that would take him throughout the world before he died.\nIn 1922, Hughes took a job on a ship and sailed to Africa. He wrote poems and short stories during his travels.

Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000\u2002b.c. Celtic tribes \u2014 probably from eastern Europe \u2014 came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comt\u00e9, Alsace, and Bur\u00adgundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar\u00adseilles) around 600\u2002b.c. , followed by other ports at Hy\u00e8res, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125\u2002b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \"Gallic barbarians,\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50\u2002b.c.

The electronic sniffer dog represents one of the latest developments in the area of smell technology.\nA Scottish company, Cascade Technologies, joined with the French security company Morpho to develop it. The device uses lasers to identify explosive materials in gases in the air. The purpose is to identify explosives that may be hidden on a person's body.\nThe machine looks similar to the metal detectors now used at airports. Passengers walk through the machine as the lasers test the surrounding air. People are not required to take off their coats, belts or shoes as part of the security process. And, unlike full-body scanners, the new device does not show images of the passengers.\nOfficials at Cascade Technologies say the machine can process one person per second and produce almost immediate results. They say future development could cut security processing times at airports by screening all passengers at walking speed.\nProfessor Yushan Yan, the head of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Riverside, points out that unlike real dogs, electronic devices do not get tired or need to be walked or require food and water. Professor Yan says real dogs also have other needs. \"They also need very extensive training that could be expensive. And when they work they have to have a very skilled handler around them.\"\nBut Professor Yan says there is an important area where man's best friend still wins compared to technology. \"In terms of sensitivity and selectivity, the current technology out there is...\nQuestion: The advantages of the electronic sniffer dog over the real dog include the following EXCEPT  _\nOptions: A: its convenience\nB: its high efficiency\nC: its sensitivity\nD: its low consumption",

        "rationale": "The electronic sniffer dog represents one of the latest developments in smell technology. It can test for explosive materials and does not require a person to remove their coats, belts or shoes as part of screening process: it is convenient and efficient. The machine can also be used with walking speed to reduce security processing times at airports: its high efficiency. In addition, unlike real dogs that need extensive training, food/water and skilled handlers \"the current technology out there...\n[Options]\n- A\n- B\n- C\n- D\n\n   [Answer]  - Question body text (if available)....is still far behind the olfactory system.\" Thus excluding sensitivity all other options are true except option C thus making answer C correct choice. So Answer Is Option 'C'!"

They are at the part where Mary has told Colin that she's found the garden her mother loved. It's an exciting moment. But the passage I'm waiting for is a few chapters on, after Colin has tasted his first breaths of fresh air and Mary has grown strong running in the garden. It's just a detail, but my kids will notice it: a delicious description of toasted potatoes and eggs.\nWe have a tradition of trying foods from the books we read aloud. It started when we read Elizabeth Enright's The Saturdays, and one of the boys asked, \"What are petit fours ?\" An answer, my husband and I felt, wouldn't be as good as a sample. So one Saturday we all sat down having tea and little cakes, covered with pink, green, and yellow. It was exciting for the kids to try a dessert they had learned about in a book. The petit fours they tried didn't tell them what it was like to live in New York City 60 years ago, but tasting them made the book's words alive.\nLater, when we read C.S.Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, we had _ . We read The Penderwicks, written by Jeanne Birdsall, and had gingerbread .We read Paddington Bear and tried marmalade .\nSoon we will reach the part of The Secret Garden where Mary, Colin, and Dickon roast potatoes and eggs in a small oven  in the earth.

        "source": "Background: Paul Klee (German: [paUl 'kle:]; 18 December 1879 - 29 June 1940) was a Swiss German artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture.\nContext: In 1919, Klee applied for a teaching post at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. This attempt failed but he had a major success in securing a three-year contract (with a minimum annual income) with dealer Hans Goltz, whose influential gallery gave Klee major exposure, and some commercial success. A retrospective of over 300 works in 1920 was also notable.  Klee taught at the Bauhaus from January 1921 to April 1931. He was a \"Form\" master in the bookbinding, stained glass, and mural painting workshops and was provided with two studios. In 1922, Kandinsky joined the staff and resumed his friendship with Klee. Later that year the first Bauhaus exhibition and festival was held, for which Klee created several of the advertising materials. Klee welcomed that there were many conflicting theories and opinions within the Bauhaus: \"I also approve of these forces competing one with the other if the result is achievement.\"  Klee was also a member of Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four), with Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky; formed in 1923, they lectured and exhibited together in the USA in 1925. That same year, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists. Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major monograph on Klee's work was published, written by Will Grohmann.  Klee also taught at the Dusseldorf Academy from 1931 to 1933, and was singled out by a Nazi newspaper, \"Then that great fellow Klee comes onto the scene, already famed as a Bauhaus teacher in Dessau. He tells everyone he's a thoroughbred Arab, but he's a typical Galician Jew.\" His home was searched by the Gestapo and he was fired from his job. His self-portrait Struck from the List (1933) commemorates the sad occasion. In 1933-4, Klee had shows in London and Paris, and finally met Pablo Picasso, whom he greatly admired. The Klee family emigrated to Switzerland in late 1933.  Klee was at the peak of his creative output. His Ad Parnassum (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his pointillist style; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings. He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany. However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as scleroderma after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso. Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year. He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others sober, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism. Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of \"Degenerate art\" and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.\nQuestion: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?",

        "source": "Miyavi was born in the Nishikujo district in Konohana-ku ward, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, to a Korean Japanese father and a Japanese mother. After the first grade, he moved to Kawanishi. His father's family, surnamed Lee, came from Jeju Island. Miyavi says that as a child he was a good student and enjoyed playing football.\n\nIn 2004, he starred as himself in the film Oresama. In February he went on his first solo tour, Tokyo Dassou, and in July additional dates were added in Korea and Taiwan. In June his seventh single, \"Ashita, Genki Ni Naare\", was released, which charted twenty-second, and number one on the indies chart. In August a small, free, fan-club-only event was organized in Tokyo Dome, and on the 31st he held his last indie concert at the Nippon Budokan. In October, he signed a major contract with Universal Music Group, but was still co-managed by PS Company. This was followed by the release of his first major (double) single, \"Rock no Gyakushuu/21sekikei Koushinkyoku\", which entered the top ten on the charts.  During May 2005 another single, \"Freedom Fighters -Icecream wo Motta Hadashi no Megami to, Kikanjuu wo Motta Hadaka no Ousama-\", was released, which charted tenth, and on June 1, his first major album, Miyavizm, was released. It was his first album to enter the top ten in the charts. It was followed by the third major single, \"Kekkon Shiki Uta/Are you ready to Rock?\", which is his best charting single, along with \"Dear My Friend\"/\"Itoshii Hito\", released in 2006; both reached number six. In December he performed at the first Peace & Smile Carnival organized by PS Company.  In late 2005 and for most of 2006, Miyavi shifted to an acoustic/pop sound reflected in his second and third major albums, MYV Pops and Miyaviuta -Dokusou-, released on August 2 and September 13 respectively. They charted at fifteenth and twenty-fifth. The first album singles, \"Senor Senora Senorita/Gigpig Boogie\" and \"Kimi ni Negai Wo\", are not different in style. They charted as tenth and twenty-sixth respectively. Miyavi showcased his new acoustic style for the first time in the 25 Shunen Kinen Koen concert series held at Tokyo Geijutsu Gekijo for five days in September around his 25th birthday. Miyavi left for America for the next six months to study the English language and take dance classes, and, on the weekends, went to Venice Beach and gave street performances.  On February 17, Miyavi, having been invited by the break dancer Mr. Freeze, performed with the local DJ and percussionist at his first solo concert in the United States, at the Tabu Ultra Lounge in the MGM Grand, Las Vegas. On May 25, at the JRock Revolution concert organized by Yoshiki Hayashi at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, it was officially announced that Miyavi would be a member of a band named S.K.I.N.. On June 29, the band held their debut and their only concert yet at the anime expo in Long Beach, California.  In June, Miyavi's seventh major single (and 14th overall), \"Sakihokoru Hana no you ni -Neo Visualizm-/Kabuki Danshi\", was released in Japan, which charted as twelfth. In July, a remixed extended play, 7 Samurai Sessions -We're Kavki Boiz-, was released, which includes re-arrangements of his past songs. It charted as forty-fourth. It was followed by Miyavi's nationwide tour, which started on July 16. He also performed at Animagic in Bonn, Germany, and in Seoul, South Korea. In November his tenth major single was released, \"Subarashikikana, Kono Sekai - What A Wonderful World\", which charted as thirteenth.  On January 16, 2008, his ninth major single was released, \"Hi no Hikari Sae Todokanai Kono Basho De\", on which he collaborated with fellow Skin guitarist Sugizo. It is his third single to enter the top ten. On March 19, his fourth major studio album was released, titled, This Iz the Japanese Kabuki Rock, which charted as twenty-fifth. In May, it was followed by his very first worldwide tour, This Iz The Japanese Kabuki Rock Tour 2008, with 33 concerts in the United States, Chile, Brazil, Germany, England, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Finland, France, Taiwan, South Korea, China and Japan. The tour covered a distance of approximately 48,385 miles, equivalent to almost two trips around the world, and the majority of the concerts were sold out and covered extensively by media organizations. It was the most successful international tour undertaken by a Japanese artist in history. On June 27, a compilation album, Azn Pride -This Iz the Japanese Kabuki Rock-, was released in Korea and Taiwan, later also in Japan, which charted as forty-fourth. In September he performed in Beijing, China. On December 24, a remix album was released, Room No. 382, which failed to enter the top hundred.  In 2009, on January 3, Miyavi performed at the 10th Anniversary Commemorative concert by PS Company at the Nippon Budokan. On April 5, Miyavi left the PS Company because their ten-year contract expired, and on April 8 launched his own company, J-Glam inc., of which he is the president. On April 22, a compilation album was released, Victory Road to the King of Neo Visual Rock, which includes all his major singles with Universal Group. On June 1, \"Super Hero,\" a new song, was released through his official Myspace, and in September his International Fanclub was opened. On September 19, Miyavi started his second worldwide tour, Neo Tokyo Samurai Black 2009/2010, in Moscow, Russia. He held 17 concerts in Europe, visiting Austria, Hungary and Italy for the first time. The tour immediately continued in South America, with concerts in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. The United States leg was canceled due to illness and an injury, but Miyavi managed to perform in November at Anime Matsuri, Texas. On December 31, he signed a new contract with EMI Music Japan.  On March 10, 2010, his first single with EMI was released, \"Survive\", via iTunes. The worldwide tour was continued on March 28, with the concert at Human Stage, Okinawa, and nationwide. In June and early July he toured throughout the United States and Canada, and in October for the first time in Australia. On September 15, his eleventh major single was released, \"Torture\". On October 13, his fifth studio album was released, What's My Name?, which charted as twenty-sixth. On November 6, he performed at the EMI Rocks 50th anniversary event at the Saitama Super Arena.  In March 2011, a new world tour, titled What's My Name?, began in Europe, with his first visit to Belgium. In April the tour continued in Japan, while in July Miyavi performed in France, and in September at the Mount Taishan MAO Rock Festival in China. In May 2011, a live album, Live in London 2011, was released, which was recorded during the London concert in March. On October 5, his twelfth major single, \"Strong\", was released, in collaboration with Japanese rapper Kreva. It was followed by the North American leg of the tour. Miyavi performed in South America at the Maquinaria festival in Chile, and visited Venezuela, Peru and Colombia for the first time.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he continue recording new music?",

        "source": "John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 - August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives.\n\nIn 2012, amongst a wide range of American and international centennial celebrations, an eight-day festival was held in Washington DC, with venues found notably more amongst the city's art museums and universities than performance spaces. Earlier in the centennial year, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas presented Cage's Song Books with the San Francisco Symphony at Carnegie Hall in New York. Another celebration came, for instance, in Darmstadt, Germany, which in July 2012 renamed its central station the John Cage Railway Station during the term of its annual new-music courses. At the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, Heiner Goebbels staged a production of Europeras 1 & 2 in a 36,000 sq ft converted factory and commissioned a production of Lecture on Nothing created and performed by Robert Wilson. Jacaranda Music had four concerts planned in Santa Monica, California, for the centennial week. John Cage Day was the name given to several events held during 2012 to mark the centenary of his birth.  A 2012 project was curated by Juraj Kojs to celebrate the centenary of Cage's birth, titled On Silence: Homage to Cage. It consisted of 13 commissioned works created by composers from around the global such as Kasia Glowicka, Adrian Knight and Henry Vega, each being 4 minutes and 33 seconds long in honor of Cage's famous 1952 opus, 4'33''. The program was supported by the Foundation for Emerging Technologies and Arts, Laura Kuhn and the John Cage Trust.  In a homage to Cage's dance work, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in July 2012 \"performed an engrossing piece called 'Story/Time'. It was modeled on Cage's 1958 work 'Indeterminacy', in which [Cage and then Jones, respectively,] sat alone onstage, reading aloud ... series of one-minute stories [they]'d written. Dancers from Jones's company performed as [Jones] read.\"\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who else contributed or sponsored the project?",

As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\".  In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.  Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind\". Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.\n\nAnswer this question \"What degree did he earn?\" by extracting the answer from the text above.",

        "source": "Ernest Edward \"Ernie\" Kovacs (January 23, 1919 - January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer. Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live.\n\nKovacs's father Andrew emigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton.  Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City. During this time, he watched many \"Grade B\" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later.  A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache. Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals. While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit.  Kovacs's first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station WTTM. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it \"Kovacs Unlimited\".

        "source": "Browning's feature film debut was Jim Bludso (1917), about a riverboat captain who sacrifices himself to save his passengers from a fire. It was well received.  Browning moved back to New York in 1917. He directed two films for Metro Studios, Peggy, the Will O' the Wisp and The Jury of Fate. Both starred Mabel Taliaferro, the latter in a dual role achieved with double exposure techniques that were groundbreaking for the time. He moved back to California in 1918 and produced two more films for Metro, The Eyes of Mystery and Revenge.  In the spring of 1918 he left Metro and joined Bluebird Productions, a subsidiary of Universal Pictures, where he met Irving Thalberg. Thalberg paired Browning with Lon Chaney for the first time for the film The Wicked Darling (1919), a melodrama in which Chaney played a thief who forces a poor girl (Priscilla Dean) from the slums into a life of crime and possibly prostitution. Browning and Chaney would ultimately make ten films together over the next decade.  The death of his father sent Browning into a depression that led to alcoholism. He was laid off by Universal and his wife left him. However, he recovered, reconciled with his wife, and got a one-picture contract with Goldwyn Pictures. The film he produced for Goldwyn, The Day of Faith, was a moderate success, putting his career back on track.  Thalberg reunited Browning with Lon Chaney for The Unholy Three (1925), the story of three circus performers who concoct a scheme to use disguises to con and steal jewels from rich people. Browning's circus experience shows in his sympathetic portrayal of the antiheroes. The film was a resounding success, so much so that it was later remade in 1930 as Lon Chaney's first (and only) talkie shortly before his death later that same year. Browning and Chaney embarked on a series of popular collaborations, including The Blackbird and The Road to Mandalay. The Unknown (1927), featuring Chaney as an armless knife thrower and Joan Crawford as his scantily clad carnival girl obsession, was originally titled Alonzo the Armless and could be considered a precursor to Freaks in that it concerns a love triangle involving a circus freak, a beauty, and a strongman. London After Midnight (1927) was Browning's first foray into the vampire genre and is a highly sought-after lost film which starred Chaney, Conrad Nagel, and Marceline Day. The last known print of London After Midnight was destroyed in an MGM studio fire in 1967. In 2002, a photographic reconstruction of London After Midnight was produced by Rick Schmidlin for Turner Classic Movies. Browning and Chaney's final collaboration was Where East is East (1929), of which only incomplete prints have survived. Browning's first talkie was The Thirteenth Chair (1929), which was also released as a silent and featured Bela Lugosi, who had a leading part as the uncanny inspector, Delzante, solving the mystery with the aid of the spirit medium. This film was directed shortly after Browning's vacation trip to Germany (arriving in the Port of New York, November 12, 1929).\n\nAnswer this question \"What film did he make after that one?\" by extracting the answer from the text above.",

She was the fourth of eight children, seven sisters and a brother. Her parents, Columbus and Gertrude, who had a white father, and Xhosa mother, were both teachers.\n\nDue to her political activities, Winnie was regularly detained by the National Party government. She was tortured, subjected to house arrest, kept under surveillance, held in solitary confinement for over a year and even banished to a remote town. She emerged as a leading opponent of apartheid during the later years of her husband's imprisonment (August 1963 - February 1990). For many of those years, she was banished to the town of Brandfort in the Orange Free State and confined to the area, except for when she was allowed to visit her husband at Robben Island. Beginning in 1969, she spent eighteen months in solitary confinement at Pretoria Central Prison. It was at this time that Winnie Mandela became well known in the Western world. She organised local clinics, campaigned actively for equal rights and was promoted by the ANC as a symbol of their struggle against apartheid.  In a leaked letter to Jacob Zuma in October 2008, outgoing President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki alluded to the role the ANC had created for her in their anti-apartheid activism:  In the context of the global struggle for the release of political prisoners in our country, our movement took a deliberate decision to profile Nelson Mandela as the representative personality of these prisoners, and therefore to use his personal political biography, including the persecution of his then wife, Winnie Mandela, dramatically to present to the world and the South African community the brutality of the apartheid system.  Beaten by the apartheid police, she developed an addiction to painkillers and alcohol as a result of a back injury caused by the assault.

Peter worked in coal mines and on the farm owned by John and Rebecca Denning, and they accepted him, allowing him to move in with them in their Henry County farm.\n\nWhile living in Decatur, McGinnity began playing baseball with other coal miners in their leisure time.

He continued to pitch from that point on. He pitched for semi-professional teams based in Decatur in 1888 and 1889. His family headed west, stopping in the Indian Territory on their way to Montana, where Hannah's sister struck gold in their coal mine. McGinnity and his brothers worked in a coal mine in Krebs. There, he met his future wife, Mary Redpath, the oldest daughter of a fellow coal miner. McGinnity also played baseball for the local team. He increased baseball's popularity in the area, and was later referred to as \"the father of Oklahoma baseball\" by a sportswriter for The Oklahoman, as he organized, managed, and pitched for teams in Krebs. One of these teams began traveling to other towns along the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad to play against their local teams. He also pitched for teams in neighboring towns.  John McCloskey, the manager of the minor league baseball Montgomery Colts of the Class-B Southern League, heard about McGinnity's pitching. McCloskey signed McGinnity, who made his professional debut with the Colts in 1893. McCloskey habitually baited umpires during games, a trait which McGinnity learned. The league folded as a result of financial troubles related to the Panic of 1893. Jimmie Manning, manager of the Southern League franchise in Savannah, Georgia, became manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-A Western League for the 1894 season, and signed McGinnity to pitch for the Blues. Combined for Montgomery and Kansas City, McGinnity had a 21-29 win-loss record, while walking more batters than he could strikeout, and allowing more than a hit per inning pitched. According to a Western League umpire, catcher Tim Donahue tipped McGinnity's pitches to opposing batters due to a personal feud. As McGinnity continued to struggle for Kansas City, he requested his release in June.  McGinnity moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he worked as a coal miner, bartender, and operated a saloon. McGinnity also pitched locally for semi-professional teams in Springfield and Decatur, receiving a salary between $1 to $3 (between $28.28 to $88.25 in current dollar terms) for each game. During this time, McGinnity developed a sidearm pitch he nicknamed \"Old Sal\", described as a \"slow curve\", which became a feature of his later success. He also improved his fielding, as opponents attempted to bunt \"Old Sal\".  While pitching for a semi-professional team, McGinnity defeated the National League's (NL) Baltimore Orioles in an exhibition game after he had already defeated a team from Chatham, Illinois earlier in the day. Pat Wright, who managed Springfield's semi-professional team, was named manager of the Peoria Distillers of the Class-B Western Association, and he signed McGinnity to Peoria for the 1898 season, marking his return to professional baseball. Armed with \"Old Sal\", McGinnity compiled a 9-4 record for Peoria, allowing only 118 hits and 60 walks while striking out 74 batters in 142 innings. He pitched a complete 21-inning game, believed to be the second longest professional baseball game to date. With low attendance and the distraction of the Spanish-American War, the Western Association folded in August.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: where did he grow up?",

Born in New York City to Japanese parents, record producer Utada Teruzane and enka singer Abe Junko, Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to Tokyo, as a result of her father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name \"Cubic U\", Utada released her English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, her Japanese-language debut First Love was released and became an instant success.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, information leaked onto the Internet that Utada's next English-language single, titled \"Come Back to Me\", would be scheduled for airplay release through U.S. Rhythmic/Crossover and Mainstream formats on February 9 and 10, 2009 respectively via Island Records. The new English album, titled This Is the One, was released on March 14, 2009 in Japan and on May 12, 2009 in the United States. This Is the One debuted at number 1 in Japan on March 13, 2009, the day it was released in Japan, but became Utada's first album not to top the weekly chart since Precious. On March 30, 2009 she appeared on New York City radio station Z-100 (100.3), the largest pop radio program in the U.S., and granted a live on-air interview on the station's Elvis Duran Morning Show, a breakthrough that would lead to a promotional schedule up and through the album's international physical release on May 12. Utada also sang the theme song for the second Evangelion film, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance. The single was released on June 27, 2009, and is a remix of her previous single, \"Beautiful World\". The new single is titled Beautiful World -PLANiTb Acoustica Mix-.  On October 14, Utada stated that she was writing lyrics that were due on October 15. She also added that some \"German magic\" would be added to the music. It was revealed that Goetz B, who had previously worked with Utada on her album Ultra Blue was in the process of mixing tracks for her.  On November 30, 2009, at Studio Coast, Tokyo, Utada sung a duet of Let It Snow with pop singer Mika.  On December 21, 2009, Utada's Dirty Desire remixes were released only on Amazon.com, Zune Marketplace, and the U.S. iTunes Store, in support of This Is the One and her upcoming tour. The tour, Utada: In the Flesh 2010, was her first concert tour outside Japan and included eight cities in the US and two dates in London, UK. The tickets for the second London performance went on public sale November 13, and reportedly sold out in just 5 hours.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did she tour at all during this time?",

He hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, and is a regular columnist for Rolling Stone Australia and was a regular columnist for LA Weekly. After performing in the short-lived Washington, D.C. band State of Alert in 1980, Rollins fronted the California hardcore punk band Black Flag from August 1981 until mid-1986. Following the band's breakup, Rollins established the record label and publishing company 2.13.61 to release his spoken word albums, and formed the Rollins Band, which toured with a number of lineups from 1987 until 2003, and during 2006.\n\nRollins and his best friend Joe Cole, son of actor Dennis Cole, were involved in a shooting when they were assaulted by robbers in December 1991 outside their shared Venice Beach, California, home. Cole died after being shot in the face, but Rollins escaped. The murder remains unsolved.  In an April 1992 Los Angeles Times interview, Rollins revealed he kept a plastic container full of soil soaked with the blood of Cole. Rollins said \"I dug up all the earth where his head fell--he was shot in the face--and I've got all the dirt here, and so Cole's in the house. I say good morning to him every day. I got his phone, too, so I got a direct line to him. So that feels good.\"  In a 2001 interview with Howard Stern, Rollins was asked about rumors that he had Cole's brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin - who was a fan of the Rollins Band - had requested to hear the then newly recorded album, The End of Silence, and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that they had a lot of money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit: \"My place is going to get popped.\"  Rollins has included Cole's story in his spoken word performances.\n\nAsk a question about this article.",

        "source": "R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, that was formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single--\"Radio Free Europe\"--in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records.\n\nAfter the band released two slow-paced albums in a row, R.E.M.'s 1994 album Monster was, as Buck said, \"a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks.\" In contrast to the sound of its predecessors, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Like Out of Time, Monster topped the charts in both the US and UK. The record sold about nine million copies worldwide. The singles \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" and \"Bang and Blame\" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from Monster reached the Top 30 on the British charts. Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from Automatic for the People for release as Parallel in 1995.  In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland, having suffered a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a hernia. Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album. The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia and released in home video form as Road Movie.  R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a reported $80 million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), rumored to be the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him by a member of the band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How was the album received by the public ?",

His father was Jewish and his mother was a Unitarian, of Scandinavian descent. He was raised in Corvallis, Oregon, from the age of two. His father introduced the young Krakauer to mountaineering at the age of eight.\n\nIn 2003, Under the Banner of Heaven became Krakauer's third non-fiction bestseller. The book examines extremes of religious belief, specifically fundamentalist offshoots of Mormonism. Krakauer looks at the practice of polygamy in these offshoots and scrutinizes it in the context of the Latter Day Saints religion throughout history. Much of the focus of the book is on the Lafferty brothers, who murdered in the name of their fundamentalist faith.  In 2006, Tom Elliott and Pawel Gula produced a documentary inspired by the book, Damned to Heaven.  Robert Millet, Professor of Religious Understanding at Brigham Young University, an LDS institution, reviewed the book and described it as confusing, poorly organized, misleading, erroneous, prejudicial and insulting. Mike Otterson, Director of Media Relations for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), told the Associated Press, \"This book is not history, and Krakauer is no historian. He is a storyteller who cuts corners to make the story sound good. His basic thesis appears to be that people who are religious are irrational, and that irrational people do strange things.\"  In response, Krakauer criticized the LDS Church hierarchy, citing the opinion of D. Michael Quinn, a historian who was excommunicated in 1993, who wrote that \"The tragic reality is that there have been occasions when Church leaders, teachers, and writers have not told the truth they knew about difficulties of the Mormon past, but have offered to the Saints instead a mixture of platitudes, half-truths, omissions, and plausible denials\".

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos  or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics. This culminated in Philip II's Pragmatica of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language.

There was a package of hotdogs , so I decided to cook two . I went into the bottom kitchen cabinet and took out a small pot . Next , with permission , I took a non-sharp butter knife and carefully opened the package of hotdogs . My mom watched me use the butter knife to make sure I did not hurt myself . I rinsed the hot dogs off and then placed them in the pot of water . Walking over to the stove , I checked to make sure it was not hot before I placed the pot on an eye . Next I reached over and turned the eye on high until the water began to boil , rapidly . Once this happened , I carefully reached over the stove and turned the eye down to medium high . I judge this by them turning darker or getting plumper . Sometimes if I am not sure , I let them cook until they start to split . When I am satisfied that they are ready , I turn the eye off and use a potholder to carefully place the pot on another eye that is not hot . Carefully I remove the pot from the stove and carry it over to the sink . I want to make sure I do not scald myself with the hot water from the pot so I run cold water in the pot for 30 seconds to one minute before I drain the water off by pouring it down the sink . Careful my mom tells me , as I almost let my hot dog slip out of the pot with the draining water . Next I get a plate and place two hotdog buns on it . I have to remember to retie the package of hotdog buns and put them back into the bread box . I open the hotdog buns up far enough to add condiments but not far enough to split them apart so that they break . My mom adds onions , relish and Sauerkraut to her hotdogs but I do n't care for any of that on mine . I prefer to add cheese . Once I have ` dressed ' my hotdog buns , I go over to the pot , take a form and remove my hotdogs before placing one on each bun . Finally I can sit down at the table and enjoy my hotdogs . Question: For how long did they let the pot sit on the stove? Option1: until hot dogs where cooked Option2: For a couple of hours.",

They gave us a program which contained a lot of information about the play , the actors and production crew , and the community theater company in general . We read that program until the play started . When the lights went down in the `` house '' -LRB- which is what they call the audience part of the theater , where you sit -RRB- , an orchestra began to play . The music at the beginning is called `` the overture . '' They played the overture for about five minutes . Then the curtain went up and the play began . There was some dancing , and as this was a play about Don Quixote and Sancho Panza , the two main characters rode `` pretend '' horses which were like boxes around their waists but you could see their legs underneath . `` Man of La Mancha '' is a funny story with a sad ending because Don Quixote -LRB- really the author Miguel de Cervantes -RRB- goes to prison . There was an intermission in the middle of the performance where they stopped the action , put the lights on in the `` house '' -LRB- where the audience sits -RRB- , and we went out into the lobby of the theater to buy a Coke . We knew the play was over when the stage curtain was lowered for the final time . The curtain did go up again , one more time , as the actors came out onstage and we applauded them .

Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. Write the sentence in natural language.\n\nSentence: Mary took out her flute and played one of her favorite pieces.

The price for movie tickets were 11.50 a piece and thats excluding popcorn etc. I said I didn\u2019t have too much money so asked whether we could split the price 50/50, as I would recieve my pocket money before that. No no no, I should pay for it, she said, because that\u2019s romantic. Well, I don\u2019t have my money, but I\u2019m sure my parents could buy it! That\u2019s not romantic either. Fine, I\u2019ll pay she said. In addition, we also could buy a rose at school, but we said to each other that we wouldn\u2019t do it and I was planning to get one before we went to the movie theatre.

He has physically and verbally abused every girlfriend he has had (4 different women). He has been arrested and has done jail time for this, and was in jail for the last 3 months for his last attack (drunk and choking his girlfriend). He drunkenly punched my ex boyfriend 4 years ago which resulted in this boyfriend having to get surgery on his jaw and eat only soft foods for a month.

Passage:On 28 January 2009, Japan announced its intention of sending a naval task force to join international efforts to stop piracy off the coast of Somalia. The deployment would be highly unusual, as Japan's non-aggressive constitution means Japanese military forces can only be used for defensive purposes. The issue has been controversial in Japan, although the ruling party maintains this should be seen as fighting crime on the high seas, rather than a \"military\" operation. The process of the Prime Minister of Japan, Taro Aso, giving his approval is expected to take approximately one month. However, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japanese government face legal problems on how to handle attacks by pirates against ships that either have Japanese personnel, cargo or are under foreign control instead of being under Japanese control as current Article 9 regulations would hamper their actions when deployed to Somalia. It was reported on 4 February 2009, that the JMSDF was sending a fact-finding mission led by Gen Nakatani to the region prior to the deployment of the Murasame-class destroyer Samidare and the Takanami-class destroyer Sazanami to the coast of Somalia with a 13-man team composed of Japanese Ministry of Defense personnel, with members coming from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the JMSDF to visit Yemen, Djibouti, Oman, and Bahrain from 8 to 20 February. Both JMSDF vessels are units of the 8th Escort Division of the 4th Escort Flotilla based in Kure, Hiroshima Prefecture. The JMSDF's special forces unit, the Special Boarding Unit is also scheduled to potentially deploy to Somalia. The SBU has been deployed alongside the two destroyers to Somalia on 14 March 2009. According to JMSDF officials, the deployment would \"regain the trust of the shipping industry, which was lost during the war.\" The JMSDF task force would be deployed off the coast of Somalia for 4 months. In its first mission, the Sazanami was able to ward off pirates attempting to hijack a Singaporean cargo ship. In addition, JMSDF P-3Cs are to be deployed in June from Djibouti to conduct surveillance on the Somali coast. The House of Representatives of Japan has passed an anti-piracy bill, calling for the JMSDF to protect non-Japanese ships and nationals, though there are some concerns that the pro-opposition House of Councillors may reject it. The Diet of Japan has passed an anti-piracy law that called for JMSDF forces to protect all foreign ships traveling off the coast of Somalia aside from protecting Japanese-owned/manned ships despite a veto from the House of Councillors, which the House of Representatives has overturned. In 2009, the Murasame-class destroyer Harusame and the Asagiri-class destroyer Amagiri left port from Yokusuka to replace the two destroyers that had been dispatched earlier in March 2009. Under current arrangements, Japan Coast Guard officers would be responsible for arresting pirates since SDF forces are not allowed to have powers of arrest.",

You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n\n The book is divided into five short stories or novellas, with an authorial preface added in the second edition. There are three major narrators. The first is a young, unnamed officer in the Russian army travelling through the Caucasus mountains. He is documenting his travels for publication later. Almost as soon as the story begins, he meets Captain Maxim Maximych, who is significantly older and has been stationed in the Caucasus for a long time. He is therefore wise to the lifestyle of Russian soldiers in this region, and immediately demonstrates this to the narrator through his interactions with the local Ossetian tribesman.\nMaxim Maximych serves as the second narrator, relaying to his traveling companion stories of his interactions with Grigory Alexandrovich Pechorin, the main character of the story and the ultimate Byronic hero. Maxim Maximych was stationed in the Caucasus with Pechorin for some time, though when and for how long is not specified. Ultimately, Maxim Maximych gives Pechorin's diaries to the unnamed narrator. Pechorin seemingly abandoned them when he was discharged from his post, and the old Captain has been carrying them around since.\nThe third narrator is Pechorin himself. However, unlike the other two, he is not actually a character immediately in the story. Instead, he narrates through his diaries, which were published along with the unnamed narrator's travel notes after Pechorin's death. The diaries, however, seem to switch at least once from the past tense (as a diary would be written) to the present tense. Pechorin, the \"hero of our time\" is shown to be alternately impulsive and calculating through Maxim Maximych's stories. He is shown to be calculating, manipulative, emotionally unavailable and arrogant through his own recollections. However he is both sensitive and cynical as well as intelligent, a fact he is all too aware of.\nIn the longest novella, Princess Mary, Pechorin flirts with the Princess of the title, while conducting an affair with his ex-lover Vera, and kills his friend Grushnitsky (of whom he is secretly contemptuous) in a duel in which the participants stand in turn on the edge of a cliff so that the loser's death can be explained as an accidental fall. Eventually he rejects one woman only to be abandoned by the other.\nThe preface explains the author's idea of his character: \"A Hero of Our Time, my dear readers, is indeed a portrait, but not of one man. It is a portrait built up of all our generation's vices in full bloom. You will again tell me that a human being cannot be so wicked, and I will reply that if you can believe in the existence of all the villains of tragedy and romance, why wouldn't believe that there was a Pechorin? If you could admire far more terrifying and repulsive types, why aren't you more merciful to this character, even if it is fictitious?

NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.\n Link Information: The first version of OS/2 was released in December 1987 Answer: December 1987",

The university founder, Fr. Sorin and the president at the time, the Rev. William Corby, immediately planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the entire University. Construction was started on the 17th of May and by the incredible zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire, a music hall was opened. Eventually becoming known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical acts put on by the school. By 1880, a science program was established at the university, and a Science Hall (today LaFortune Student Center) was built in 1883. The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early research at the university.",

Benefits of Steel Alloying Agents: Different alloying elements each have their own effect on the properties of steel. 1  Some of the properties that can be improved through alloying include: 2  Stabilizing austenite: Elements such as nickel, manganese, cobalt, and copper increase the temperatures range in which austenite exists. However, whether present as a residual element or added deliberately as an alloying element, the effects of N in steel are significant. N is an important and inexpensive alloying addition to steels. In recent years there has been an increasing demand to reduce and control the amount of dissolved gases in steel. In case of N being used as a deliberate alloying element in steels, N is added to liquid steel in the form of nitrogen bearing alloying additions or as gaseous nitrogen itself. Nitriding alloys are alloy steels with nitride-forming elements such as aluminum, chromium, molybdenum and titanium. History. Systematic investigation into the effect of nitrogen on the surface properties of steel began in the 1920s. Investigation into gas nitriding began independently in both Germany and America. The process was greeted with enthusiasm in Germany and several steel grades were developed with nitriding in mind: the so-called nitriding steels. Nitrogen and steel properties. Nitrogen can influence steel properties either in a detrimental or beneficial way depending on the presence of other elements in the steel, the form and quantity of nitrogen, and the required behavior of the steel. Normally most of the steels need nitrogen at the minimum level. Duplex stainless steels have a mixture of austenitic and ferritic grains in their microstructure; hence they have a \u201cduplex\u201d structure. This effect is achieved by adding less nickel than would be necessary for making a fully austenitic stainless steel. Salt bath nitriding. In salt bath nitriding the nitrogen donating medium is a nitrogen-containing salt such as cyanide salt. The salts used also donate carbon to the workpiece surface making salt bath a nitrocarburizing process. The temperature used is typical of all nitrocarburizing processes: 550\u2013570 \u00b0C. Numerous sources of nitrogen exist during the melting, ladle processing and casting operations of steel. Sources of nitrogen in oxygen steelmaking include hot metal, the scrap, impurity nitrogen in oxygen and the nitrogen used as a stirring gas. Nitrogen pickup from the atmosphere can occur during steel for at least 15 min after the addition of potassium bisulfate. Brown [4] describes a pro\u00ad cedure for the determination of total nitrogen in steel wherein the steel is dissolved in a mixture of diluted sulfuric and phosphoric acids, metallic selenium is added, and, after the removal of water, Fig 4 Effect of nitrogen on strain ageing index of steel. Effect during welding \u2013 Nitrogen generally affects the toughness of the heat affected zone (HAZ) of welded steel. Since the weld metal should not be weaker in a welded structure, the role of nitrogen is important. The loss of toughness is normally known as HAZ embrittlement.",

Later that year she was deployed to Famagusta, Cyprus, and Haifa, Palestine to assist British forces in putting down riots from December 1935 \u2013 January 1936. Boadicea had to return to Haifa in June to help put down the beginnings of the Arab Revolt.

She remained with the 4th Flotilla until January 1939 and made multiple deployments off the coast of Spain enforcing the embargo until April 1938 when she was again refitted. After leaving the 4th Flotilla, Boadicea served as the plane guard for the aircraft carriers of the Mediterranean Fleet for a few months until she became the emergency destroyer at the Nore.

I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ...\" The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover F\u00e9licien Mallefille.

Passage:In the fall of 1777 forces of the British Army successfully captured Philadelphia, the seat of the Second Continental Congress, which was forced to relocate to York, Pennsylvania. The series of military setbacks (principally the losses at Brandywine in September and Germantown in October) caused many in the Continental Army and Congress to question George Washington's leadership of the war effort. In contrast, the northern army of General Horatio Gates had won a signal victory over John Burgoyne's forces, compelling Burgoyne to surrender his entire army after the Battles of Saratoga. Gates controversially claimed credit for the victory. Some historians feel that this was more due to the actions of Benedict Arnold, who, in the first battle on September 19, effectively and almost independently defended his forces against British assaults. It was also alleged that Gates had failed to provide Arnold with adequate reinforcements which would have turned the battle into an outright American victory, although there is not universal agreement on this matter. Gates was politically well connected to Congress. Some congressmen such as Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, and Samuel Adams wanted tighter Congressional control of the war effort and supported Gates. Although John Adams did not specifically call for Washington to be replaced, he worried that Washington was being made into a military idol, and was fearful of the effects of this upon republicanism.",

Pitch, in turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. High-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the piccolo in the Figure 1.1, have high-frequency waves. Low-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the tuba Figure 1.1, have low-frequency waves. The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound. Infrasound is too low-pitched for humans to hear. Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound. Ultrasound is too high-pitched for humans to hear. Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogsbut not peoplecan hear. The whistles produce sounds with frequencies too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, like the one pictured in the Figure 1.2, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz! Q: Bats use ultrasound to navigate in the dark. Can you explain how? A: Bats send out ultrasound waves, which reflect back from objects ahead of them.

Passage 1:German Namibians () are a community of people descended from ethnic German colonists who settled in present-day Namibia. In 1883, the German trader Adolf L\u00fcderitz bought what would become the southern coast of Namibia from Josef Frederiks II, a chief of the local Oorlam people, and founded the city of L\u00fcderitz. The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, proclaiming it German South West Africa (). Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials. In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost its colonial possessions, including South West Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former German colony was administered as a South African mandate. The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory alongside Afrikaans and English.\n Passage 2:Earle L. Reynolds (October 18, 1910 \u2013 January 11, 1998) was an anthropologist, educator, author, Quaker, and peace activist. He was sent to Hiroshima by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to study the effects of the first atomic bomb on the growth and development of exposed children. His professional discoveries concerning the dangers of radiation later moved Reynolds into a life of anti-nuclear activism. In 1958 he sailed with his wife Barbara, two of his three children and a Japanese yachtsman in the Phoenix of Hiroshima, a ketch he had designed himself, into the American nuclear testing zone in the Pacific. In 1961 the family sailed to the USSR to protest Soviet nuclear testing. During the Vietnam War Reynolds and his second wife Akie sailed the Phoenix to Haiphong to deliver humanitarian and medical aid to victims of American bombing.\n Passage 3:The Anita Kerr Singers or The Jordanaires sang background on just about every Nashville hit in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

She no longer wanted to just be a background singer or arranger on country songs \u2013 she wanted to do pop music, jazz and \"do more orchestral writing and music that was not just country.\". She hired some lawyers to get her out of her contract with RCA\u2019s Nashville division, got a contract with Warner Bros. Records, and formed a Los Angeles version of the Anita Kerr Singers. The new group, for the next five years, would include the following personnel: alto B.J. Baker or Jackie Ward, tenor Gene Merlino or Bill Cole, baritone Bill Lee, bass Bob Tebow, and Kerr herself as soprano and arranger. The half dozen albums recorded by the Singers for Warner included a cover version of the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by The Beatles, and one of the LPs was exclusively devoted to the songs of composer Bert Kaempfert. Disguising the group as the Mexicali Singers, Kerr also recorded a trio of mariachi-flavored albums with musical arrangements reminiscent of the Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass sound.

Activists thronged the financial heart of London on Monday, unfurling banners, addressing passersby by megaphone or blocking streets around locations including BlackRock, the Bank of England, Bank of China and Barclays. At BlackRock, volunteers glued themselves to the doors while others staged a mock dinner party with rolled-up banknotes on their plates. Police said they arrested more than 90 people. The arrestees included Rabbi Jeffrey Newman of the Finchley Reform Synagogue, who was arrested near the Bank of England praying, singing and wearing a prayer shawl for the first day of the Jewish festival Sukkot, Extinction Rebellion said. \u201cThe City of London is a preeminent nexus of power in the global system that is killing our world,\u201d said Carolina Rosa, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion. BlackRock declined to comment. Police later ordered a halt to all assembly linked to   Extinction Rebellion in London. At Trafalgar Square in the heart of the city, where demonstrators have pitched camp for the past week amid fountains at the base of Nelson\u2019s Column, protesters began removing tents. Police made no immediate move to shut down another main protest camp in the district of Vauxhall. \u201cOfficers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor. Extinction Rebellion said it had left Trafalgar Square but would continue actions in London and cities around the world. \u201cThe Climate and Ecological Emergency isn\u2019t going away and we remain resolute in facing it. We urge the Government and the authorities to join us in doing the same,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThis is bigger than all of us.\u201d   Extinction Rebellion wants to cause enough disruption to force governments to rapidly cut carbon emissions and reverse the collapse of ecosystems to avert the worst of the devastation scientists project if business as usual continues. Critics say the group is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of capitalism without any clear idea of what would follow, and that the world needs fossil fuels. Extinction Rebellion said that more than 1,400 people had been arrested in London since it launched its latest actions a week ago. A similar number has in total been arrested in 20 cities in countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. While activists have long targeted fossil fuel companies, a growing global climate protest movement is increasingly scrutinizing the role fund managers, banks and insurance companies play in enabling oil and gas extraction. Emily Grossman, a British science broadcaster who has a PhD in molecular biology, who joined the protest outside BlackRock, said that financing fossil fuel projects was undermining the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming. \u201cThis is criminal damage that they are doing to our lives and to the lives of our children and it has to stop,\u201d said Grossman, who was later led away by police. Major oil companies have approved $50 billion of projects since last year that run contrary to the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to an analysis published last month by financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. Fossil fuel companies say they need to invest in new projects to meet future demand for energy, particularly in fast-growing regions such as Asia. Climate protesters want to pressure index fund firms such as BlackRock because the sector, which now controls half the U.S. stock mutual fund market, has enormous power to influence companies in which they invest trillions of dollars. The leading U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, rarely use that clout, a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records found this month.

However, the article states that a growing global climate protest movement is increasingly scrutinizing the role fund managers, banks and insurance companies play in enabling oil and gas extraction as well as financing fossil fuel projects which contradicts with the claims made by John Faso. Also, major oil companies have approved $50 billion of projects since last year that run contrary to the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change mitigation. This implies that governments are willing to invest billions in funding for new fossil fueled energy production projects despite public outcry against them (e.g., Extinction Rebellion). The author's overall tone towards government investment in these types of carbon emitting industries goes against Mr. Faso's claim about their aim at taking people's land"

So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.\n\nA situation that comes to mind as one that was striking and memorable happened around 2 weeks ago.

I couldn't believe that this was a journey we were going to start taking together. Later that night, we spent a long time sitting and talking about everything. We went over some decisions we are going to have to make for our baby, and how we would make them. She asked me for help finding a doctor and getting an appointment set up.

A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\nDid M2 influence a Swedish film director",

Therefore, we examined whether the offspring from dams exposed to a high-fat diet during pregnancy (OH mice) exhibited hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia along with epigenetic changes in the expression of adipocytokine genes. OH mice were significantly heavier than the offspring of dams exposed to a control diet during pregnancy (OC mice) from 14 wk of age after an increased caloric intake from 8 wk. OH mice exhibited higher blood pressure and worse glucose tolerance than the OC mice at 24 wk. Total triglyceride and leptin levels were significantly higher and the adiponectin level was significantly lower in OH compared with OC mice at 12 wk of age. This was associated with changes in leptin and adiponectin expression in white adipose tissue. There were lower acetylation and higher methylation levels of histone H3 at lysine 9 of the promoter of adiponectin in adipose tissues of OH mice at 2 wk of age as well as at 12 and 24 wk of age compared with OC mice. In contrast, methylation of histone 4 at lysine 20 in the leptin promoter was significantly higher in OH compared with OC mice.

Vitrification of the sample to obtain a dense distribution of particles within a single field of view remains a major bottleneck for the success of such experiments. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method to increase the density of frozenhydrated particles on grids with holey carbon support films. It relies on performing multiple rounds of sample application and blotting prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane. We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies.

Pneumonia is most common at the extremes of life. Predisposing factors in children include an underdeveloped immune system together with other factors, such as malnutrition and overcrowding. In adults, tobacco smoking is the single most important preventable risk factor. The commonest infecting organisms in children are respiratory viruses and Streptoccocus pneumoniae. In adults, pneumonia can be broadly classified, on the basis of chest radiographic appearance, into lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and pneumonia producing an interstitial pattern. Lobar pneumonia is most commonly associated with community acquired pneumonia, bronchopneumonia with hospital acquired infection and an interstitial pattern with the so called atypical pneumonias, which can be caused by viruses or organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Most cases of pneumonia can be managed with chest radiographs as the only form of imaging, but CT can detect pneumonia not visible on the chest radiograph and may be of value, particularly in the hospital setting. Complications of pneumonia include pleural effusion, empyema and lung abscess. The chest radiograph may initially indicate an effusion but ultrasound is more sensitive, allows characterisation in some cases and can guide catheter placement for drainage.

Although piRNAs are produced independently of Dicer, miRNA and esiRNA biogenesis pathways require Dicer1 and Dicer2, respectively. Recent studies have shown that among the four isoforms of Loquacious (Loqs), Loqs-PB and Loqs-PD are involved in miRNA and esiRNA processing pathways, respectively. However, how these Loqs isoforms function in their respective small RNA biogenesis pathways remains elusive. Here, we show that Loqs-PD associates specifically with Dicer2 through its C-terminal domain. The Dicer2-Loqs-PD complex contains R2D2, another known Dicer2 partner, and excises both exogenous siRNAs and esiRNAs from their corresponding precursors in vitro. However, Loqs-PD, but not R2D2, enhanced Dicer2 activity. The Dicer2-Loqs-PD complex processes esiRNA precursor hairpins with long stems, which results in the production of AGO2-associated small RNAs. Interestingly, however, small RNAs derived from terminal hairpins of esiRNA precursors are loaded onto AGO1; thus, they are classified as a new subset of miRNAs. These results suggest that the precursor RNA structure determines the biogenesis mechanism of esiRNAs and miRNAs, thereby implicating hairpin structures with long stems as intermediates in the evolution of Drosophila miRNA.",

In an effort to determine the effect of amyloid in an animal model, the authors injected amyloid cores isolated from AD brains into the cortex and hippocampus of rats. Lipofuscin, a major contaminant of the plaque core preparation, was injected on the contralateral side and used as a control to induce an analogous phagocytic cell response. Rats were sacrificed 2 days, 7 days, and 1 month after injection and amyloid located by four histochemical techniques. Amyloid and lipofuscin move from the site of injection into otherwise undamaged neuropil, persist for at least 1 month and are both associated with increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein and microglia (OX-42) staining. By 1 week, many of the amyloid cores are ingested by phagocytes. Some of the beta-amyloid-containing phagocytes migrate to the vessels and to the ventricles, and by 1 month, a significant amount of the amyloid is directly associated with the vessels. This suggests that phagocytic cells can internalize exogenous amyloid and attempt to clear it from the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, the observed distribution of amyloid is not necessarily the initial site of deposition..

It also discusses whether phagocytes are able to clear exogenous amyloid from animal brains by ingesting it, which is one possible mechanism for clearing preformed plaques. Finally, there is evidence suggesting that some beta-amyloid deposits end up associated with vessels within 1 month after injection into rats' brains. This means they could potentially travel through blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to other brain regions where they might become incorporated into new amyloid plaques if proper clearance mechanisms fail. The results support the idea that systemic spread of extrace"

However, following cholecystectomy, 20% of patients remain symptomatic. It is unclear to what extent post-cholecystectomy symptoms can be ascribed to persistence of preoperative symptoms or to new pathology. The pain and digestive pattern in gallstone patients has not been defined in a recent setting with ultrasonography as the diagnostic method. The aim of this study was to characterize a pain pattern that is typical for gallstone disease and to describe the extent of associated dyspepsia.    MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 220 patients with symptomatic gallstone disease including complicated disease (acute cholecystitis and common bile duct stones) were interviewed using detailed questionnaires to disclose pain patterns and symptoms of indigestion.   \n RESULTS All patients had pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) including the upper midline epigastrium. The pain was localized to the right subcostal area in 20% and to the upper epigastrium in 14%, and in the rest (66%) it was more evenly distributed. An area of maximal pain could be defined in 90%. Maximal pain was located under the costal arch in 51% of patients and in the epigastrium in 41%, but in 3% behind the sternum and in 5% in the back. The pain was referred to the back in 63% of the patients. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score was very high: 90 mm on a 0-100 scale. A pattern of incipient or low-grade warning pain with a subsequent relatively steady state until subsiding in the same fashion was present in 90% of the patients. An urge to walk around was experienced by 71%. Pain attacks usually occurred in the late evening or at night (77%), with 85% of the attacks lasting for more than one hour and almost never less than half an hour. Sixty-six percent of the patients were intolerant to at least one kind of food, but only 48% to fatty foods. Symptoms of functional indigestion (gastroesophageal reflux, dyspepsia or irritable bowel symptoms) were seen in the vast majority in association with attacks.   \n CONCLUSIONS Gallstone-associated pain follows a certain pattern in the majority of patients. The pain is located in a defined area with a point of maximum intensity, is usually referred, and occurs mainly at night with duration of more than one hour. The majority of patients experience functional indigestion, mainly of the reflux type or dyspepsia.",

So my suggestion would be: \"Pain attacks in non-complicated and complicated gallstone disease have a characteristic pattern and are accompanied by dyspepsia in most patients: the results of a prospective study\""

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARMS-I\u2122 (currently marketed as Halo\u2122) in the prevention of URIs. Methods: ARMS-I is patented novel formulation for the prevention and treatment of influenza, comprising a broadspectrum antimicrobial agent (cetylpyridinium chloride, CPC) and components (glycerin and xanthan gum) that form a barrier on the host mucosa, thus preventing viral contact and invasion. Healthy adults (18-45 years of age) were randomized into ARMS-I or placebo group (50 subjects each). The drug was sprayed intra-orally (3\u00d7 daily) for 75 days. The primary objectives were to establish whether ARMS-I decreased the frequency, severity or duration of URIs. Secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, tolerability, rate of virus detection, acceptability and adherence; effect on URI-associated absenteeism and medical visits; and effect of prior influenza vaccination on study outcomes. Results: Of the 94 individuals who completed the study (placebo: n = 44, ARMS-I: n = 50), six presented with confirmed URI (placebo: 4, ARMS-I: 2), representing a 55% relative reduction, albeit this was statistically not significant). Influenza, coronavirus or rhinovirus were detected in three participants; all in the placebo group. Moreover, frequency of posttreatment exit visits was reduced by 55% in ARMS-I compared to the placebo group (N = 4 and 2, respectively). Fever was reported only in the placebo group. ARMS-I significantly reduced the frequency and severity of cough and sore throat, and duration of cough (P \u2264 .019 for all comparisons). ARMS-I was safe, well tolerated, had high acceptability and high adherence to medication use. Medical visits occurred only in the placebo group while absenteeism did not differ between the two arms. Prior influenza vaccination had no effect on study outcome. Conclusions: This randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial demonstrated that ARMS-I tended to provide protection against URIs in the enrolled study participants, while reducing severity and duration of cough and sore throat. A clinical trial with a larger number of study participants is warranted. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02644135 (retrospectively registered). \n Title: Randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of a novel dual-action oral topical formulation against upper respiratory infections",

Under general anaesthesia, there were significant reductions in mean cardiac output, hepatic and renal blood flow (to 54%, 63% and 43% of control); chlormethiazole mean hepatic extraction ratios and clearance were reduced, respectively, to 82% and 56% of control, and its pulmonary and renal clearances were abolished.

The occurrence of both phenomena in the same patient made it possible to study cross-reactivity patterns of potato antigens. An 11-year-old girl, exclusively breast-fed for her first 4 months, developed anaphylactic symptoms after ingestion of potato at 5 months of age when she was fed potato for the first time. Subsequently, she developed urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory and systemic symptoms on contact with potatoes, ingestion of potatoes, and exposure to cooking potatoes or potato pollen. Three allergenic extracts from potato pulp, peel, and pollen were prepared. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectrofocusing of the three extracts were performed. IgE-mediated allergy to these extracts was demonstrated by means of immediate skin test reactivity, positive passive transfer, RAST, RAST inhibition, and leukocyte histamine release. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pulp extract followed by electroblotting and autoradiography demonstrated specific IgE antibodies directed against several proteins ranging from 14,000 to 40,000 daltons. \nQuestion Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Case Report 2)Eosinophilia 3)Human",

The classical label propagation method, despite its popularity, has limited modeling capability in that it only exploits graph information for making predictions. In this paper, we consider label propagation from a graph signal processing perspective and decompose it into three components: signal, filter, and classifier. By extending the three components, we propose a simple generalized label propagation (GLP) framework for semi-supervised learning. GLP naturally integrates graph and data feature information, and offers the flexibility of selecting appropriate filters and domain-specific classifiers for different applications. Interestingly, GLP also provides new insight into the popular graph convolutional network and elucidates its working mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three citation networks, one knowledge graph, and one image dataset demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of GLP.",
